<H3>Understanding the Bhu-mandala: A Vedic Perspective</H3>
<p><strong>By GaurangaSundar Das</strong></p>
<p>&quot;Harināma Saṅkīrtana&quot; - Saṅkīrtana is yuga dharma for Kali-yuga people and Caitanya Mahāprabhu personally come to give that process in Bhārata-varṣa. It is not for different dimension! Due to modern cosmology missunderstanding of Globe fake Earth the yuga dharma is not fully manifested&quot;. </p>
<P>So let us put aside for a moment what we assume the Earth to look like, and just take in the actual description of Bhārata-varṣa from the Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam. If we present the Earth as a globe in space, it means we haven't listened to, comprehended, or represented (re-presented) the actual description given by Śukadeva Goswami and the other Vedic sages who provide geographical descriptions of Bhārata-varṣa in many places throughout the Purāṇas. At least from the descriptions of Earth provided, we are not hearing anything that remotely resembles a globe-shaped planet.</P>
<P>The problem for most of us in conceptualizing what Earth looks like is because we have been convinced that we are on NASA's ball in space. If we are to believe Śrīmad Bhāgavatam and take Śukadeva Goswami at his word, then we are actually not that far from our earthly neighbours on Bhārata-varṣa, and from our more pious neighbours on Jambūdvīpa. In reality we are only a few thousand miles away. We are surrounded by the same salt water ocean. Think about that; the salt water ocean surrounding Jambūdvīpa is the same salt water ocean that surrounds our own continents. This is because we are actually part of Jambūdvīpa, <strong>but just separated by ocean and ice</strong> (<strong>Arctic and Antarctica</strong>). The idea that Jambudvīpa is in another dimension and not visible to our senses is defeated by the following verse from Śrīmad Bhāgavatam:</P>
<P align="center"><a href="http://www.iskcon-truth.com/bhu-mandala/bhumandala-jambudvipa/ganga-brahma-puri3.png" target="_blank"><img src="http://www.iskcon-truth.com/bhu-mandala/bhumandala-jambudvipa/ganga-brahma-puri3.png" alt="The Descent of the River Ganges - Gaṅgā" width="580" height="323"></a></P>
<P>On&nbsp;top&nbsp;of&nbsp;Mount&nbsp;Meru, <strong>the Ganges  divides into four branches</strong>, each&nbsp;of&nbsp;which gushes in a different direction [east, west,  north and south]. These branches, known by the names&nbsp;<strong>Sītā</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>Alakanandā</strong>, <strong>Cakṣu</strong> and&nbsp;<strong>Bhadrā</strong>, flow down to the  ocean. (<a href="https://prabhupadabooks.com/sb/5/17/5" target="_blank">sb/5/17/5</a>)</P>
<P>The branch of the Ganges known as the&nbsp;Sītā&nbsp;flows through  Brahmapurī atop Mount&nbsp;Meru, and from there it runs down to the  nearby peaks of the&nbsp;Kesarācala&nbsp;Mountains, which stand almost  as high as Mount&nbsp;Meru&nbsp;itself. These mountains are like a bunch  of filaments around Mount&nbsp;Meru. From the&nbsp;Kesarācala&nbsp;Mountains,  the Ganges falls to the peak of&nbsp;Gandhamādana&nbsp;Mountain and then  flows into the land of&nbsp;Bhadrāśva-varṣa. Finally it reaches  the ocean of salt water in the west. (<a href="https://prabhupadabooks.com/sb/5/17/6" target="_blank">sb/5/17/6</a>)</P>
<p>The branch of the Ganges known as Cakṣu falls onto the summit of&nbsp;Mālyavān&nbsp;Mountain  and from there cascades onto the land of&nbsp;Ketumāla-varṣa. The  Ganges flows incessantly through&nbsp;Ketumāla-varṣa&nbsp;and in  this way also reaches the ocean of salt water in the West. (<a href="https://prabhupadabooks.com/sb/5/17/7" target="_blank">sb/5/17/7</a>)</p>
<P align="center"><a href="http://www.iskcon-truth.com/bhu-mandala/bhumandala-jambudvipa/ganga-brahma-puri2.png" target="_blank"><img src="http://www.iskcon-truth.com/bhu-mandala/bhumandala-jambudvipa/ganga-brahma-puri2.png" alt="The Descent of the River Ganges - Gaṅgā" width="580" height="326"></a></P>
<P>The branch&nbsp;of&nbsp;the Ganges known as&nbsp;Bhadrā&nbsp;flows from  the northern side&nbsp;of&nbsp;Mount&nbsp;Meru. Its waters fall onto the peaks&nbsp;of&nbsp;Kumuda&nbsp;Mountain, Mount&nbsp;Nīla,  Śveta Mountain and Śṛṅgavān Mountain in succession. Then it runs down into the  province&nbsp;of&nbsp;Kuru&nbsp;and,  after crossing through that land, flows into the saltwater ocean in the north.  (<a href="https://prabhupadabooks.com/sb/5/17/8" target="_blank">sb/5/17/8</a>)</P>
<p>Similarly, the branch of the Ganges known as&nbsp;Alakanandā&nbsp;flows  from the southern side of Brahmapurī [Brahma-sadana]. Passing  over the tops of mountains in various lands, it falls down with fierce force  upon the peaks of the mountains Hemakūṭa and Himakūṭa. After inundating the  tops of those mountains, the Ganges falls down onto the tract of land known as&nbsp;Bhārata-varṣa,  which she also inundates. Then the Ganges flows into the ocean of salt water in  the south.&nbsp; (<a href="https://prabhupadabooks.com/sb/5/17/9" target="_blank">sb/5/17/9</a>)</p>
<p>Many other rivers, both big and small, flow from the&nbsp;top&nbsp;of&nbsp;Mount&nbsp;Meru. These rivers are like daughters&nbsp;of&nbsp;the mountain, and they flow to the various tracts&nbsp;of&nbsp;land in hundreds&nbsp;of&nbsp;branches. (<a href="https://prabhupadabooks.com/sb/5/17/10" target="_blank">sb/5/17/10</a>)</p>
<p align="center"><a href="http://www.iskcon-truth.com/bhu-mandala/bhumandala-jambudvipa/ganga-brahma-puri1.png" target="_blank"><img src="http://www.iskcon-truth.com/bhu-mandala/bhumandala-jambudvipa/ganga-brahma-puri1.png" alt="The Descent of the River Ganges - Gaṅgā" width="580" height="349"></a></p>
<P>So here it is clearly explained that the same sacred Ganges water that is seen by Brahmā at Brahmā Purī (atop Mount Meru) is likewise seen by ISKCON devotees in Māyāpur. Like Brahmā, we offer obeisances to Gaṅgā in Māyāpur before taking a dip three times. Where is the Gaṅgā that flows through Māyāpur coming from? She is coming from the transcendental realm via the southern side of Brahmapurī which rests on the top of Mount Meru. Where does she flow to? She flows into the ocean of salt water in the south? What is the ocean of salt water. It is the 800,000 mile ocean that surrounds Jambudvīpa. That is our salt water ocean. It is not in a different dimension or 'higher realm' or anything of the sort. It is the same salt water we swim in, and sail upon; it's just that we only get to see a small part of it. But it is otherwise clearly within our dimension and physicality. If we were to keep sailing on the salt water ocean in any direction we would reach other parts of Bhārata-varṣa and Jambudvīpa. At the present moment a 'superior force' to quote Prabhupāda prevents us from going further.</P>

<p>After purifying the seven planets near Dhruvaloka [the  polestar], the Ganges water is carried through the spaceways of the demigods in  billions of celestial airplanes. Then it inundates the moon [Candraloka] and finally reaches Lord  Brahmā’s abode atop Mount&nbsp;Meru.</p>

<P>We should always remember that the Ganges River comes from  the Causal Ocean, beyond the covering of the universe. After the water of the  Causal Ocean leaks through the hole created by Lord Vāmanadeva, it flows down  to Dhruvaloka (the polestar) and then to the seven planets beneath Dhruvaloka. Then  it is carried to the moon by innumerable celestial airplanes, and then it falls  to the top of Mount&nbsp;Meru, which is known as&nbsp;Sumeru-parvata. In this  way, the water of the Ganges finally reaches the lower planets and the peaks of  the Himalayas, and from there it flows through Hardwar and throughout the  plains of India, purifying the entire land. How the Ganges water reaches the  various planets from the top of the universe is explained herein. Celestial  airplanes carry the water from the planets of the sages to other planets. So-called  advanced scientists of the modern age are trying to go to the higher planets,  but at the same time they are experiencing a power shortage on earth. If they  were actually capable scientists, they could personally go by airplane to other  planets, but this they are unable to do. Having now given up their moon  excursions, they are attempting to go to other planets, but without success. (<a href="https://prabhupadabooks.com/sb/5/17/4" target="_blank">SB.5.17.4</a>) </P>

<P>The place  where the Ganges flows into the salt water of the Bay of Bengal is still known  as&nbsp;Gaṅgā-sāgara, or the meeting place of the Ganges and the Bay of Bengal.  On&nbsp;Makara-saṅkrānti, in the month of January–February, thousands of people  still go there to bathe, hoping to be liberated. That they can actually  be liberated in this way is confirmed herein. For those who bathe in the Ganges at any time,  the results of great sacrifices like the&nbsp;Aśvamedha&nbsp;and&nbsp;Rājasūya&nbsp;yajñas&nbsp;are  not at all difficult to achieve. Most people in India are still inclined  to bathe in the Ganges, and there are many places where they can do so. At&nbsp;Prayāga&nbsp;(Allahabad),  many thousands of people gather during the month of January to bathe in the  confluence of the Ganges and&nbsp;Yamunā. Afterward, many of them go to  the confluence of the Bay of Bengal and the Ganges to take bath there. Thus it  is a special facility for all the people of India that they can bathe in the  water of the Ganges at so many places of pilgrimage.</P>

<P>&quot;<strong>Yuga dharma Harināma Saṅkīrtana is not for different dimension</strong>!&quot;</P>
<P>Of Ṛṣabhadeva's one hundred sons, the eldest, named Bhārata, was a great, exalted devotee qualified with the best attributes. In his honor, this planet has become known as Bhārata-varṣa.</P>
<P>This planet known as Bhārata-varṣa is also called puṇya-bhūmi, the pious land. At the present moment Bhārata-bhūmi, or Bhārata-varṣa, is a small piece of land extending from the Himalaya Mountains to Cape Comorin. Sometimes this peninsula is called puṇya-bhūmi. Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu has given special importance to the people of this land.</P>
<P align="center"><em>bhārata-bhūmite haila manuṣya-janma yāra<BR>

<P>&quot;One who has taken his birth as a human being in the land of India (Bhārata-varṣa) should make his life successful and work for the benefit of all other people.&quot; (Cc. Ādi 9.41)</P>
<P><strong>The inhabitants of this piece of land are very fortunate. They can purify their existence by accepting this Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement and go outside Bhārata-bhūmi (India) and preach this cult to benefit the whole world</strong>. (SB.5.4.9)</P>

<p><strong>Above the rays of the sunshine by a distance of  100,000 yojanas [800,000 miles] is the moon, which travels at a speed faster  than that of the sun.

<p>When we  take into account that the moon is 100,000&nbsp;<em>yojanas,</em>&nbsp;or 800,000  miles, <strong>above the rays of the sunshine</strong>, it is very surprising that the modern  excursions to the moon could be possible. Since the moon is so distant, how  space vehicles could go there is a doubtful mystery. Modern scientific  calculations are subject to one change after another, and therefore they are  uncertain. We have to accept the calculations of the Vedic literature. These  Vedic calculations are steady; the astronomical calculations made long ago and  recorded in the Vedic literature are correct even now. Whether the Vedic  calculations or modern ones are better may remain a mystery for others, but as  far as we are concerned, we accept the Vedic calculations to be correct.

<P>UNITING THE UNIVERSE WITH HARINĀMA &nbsp;SAṄKĪRTAN / WHY FAKE THE GLOBE?</P>
<P>&quot;Vedic planetarium is a very important project of the saṅkīrtana movement to enlighten the people in Earth's region of Bhārata-varṣa about their real position in the cosmos&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Both Śrīmad Bhāgavatam and Mahābhārata assert that the Pāṇḍavas were entering into this area and indeed governing all of his vast area of Jambūdvīpa from their capital in India. Access to Jambudvīpa was possible at that point, but about 5,000 years ago we entered into the Kali-yuga period (the age of fighting and hypocrisy) <strong>and our particular place in Bhārata-varṣa became isolated from the mainland of Jambūdvīpa</strong>. It is mentioned in various Purāṇas that the yugas (four repeating cycles of time that bring about variations in people's mind, behaviour, and environment) only affect Bhārata-varṣa and not the other varṣas of Jambūdvīpa were pious people live happily enjoying the results of their previous karma. For that reason we are put into a kind of quarantine. As the Kali-yuga progressed, the Vedic empire was broken up, people in different parts of the world became isolated, and the whole atmosphere degraded. Consequently the Vedic knowledge was withdrawn, including knowledge of our relation to the other parts of our world as well as the greater knowledge of the world's relation to Jambudvīpa. Jambudvīpa became the stuff of mere myth and legend: the Greek Olympus; The Nordic Asgard; the Buddhist Śambala.</P>
<P align="center"><img src="http://www.iskcon-truth.com/bhu-mandala/bhumandala-jambudvipa/Shambhala.jpg" alt="Mystic City Śambhala in the Himalayas" width="580" height="365"></P>
<P class="Stil1"><em>Śambhala is  said to date back thousands of years, and reference to the mythical land can be  found in various ancient texts and the Purāṇas. The Viṣṇu-Purāṇa mention Śambhala  as the birth place of Kalki, the final incarnation of Viṣṇu who will usher in a  new Golden Age at the end of Kali-yuga.</em></P>
<P align="center"><strong>THE FAKE GLOBE</strong></P>
<P><STRONG>Rajasekhara Prabhu asked why would anyone fake the globe</STRONG>. <U>Actually the deception starts with Māyādevī herself. The general ignorance and materialism prevailing in Kali-yuga is part of māyā's arrangement to further facilitate the soul's illusion of a life devoid of God</U>. </P>
<P>In Kali-yuga the crude and base desires of the human beings are allowed free reign. Knowledge of the soul, God, and the creation is gradually covered over so that the more perverse aspects of material existence can be experienced, and their severe karmic reactions ignored by the materialistic people destined to take birth at this time. Knowledge and experience of God's wide creation along the Bhū-maṇḍala and throughout the universe is withdrawn and the expanded flat Earth is gradually replaced by such illusions as the globe model. The globe model is a spell-like speculation that literally traps one in a bubble—a prison planet floating alone in lifeless Godless empty space. Since there is no God, whoever controls the prison planet controls your being. Such are the fearful illusions that follow as a result of turning from God and the truth. The materialist is given over to the deceptions, untruths, and illusions created by atheistic agencies such as NASA. Such agencies are empowered by the Lord's own māyā potency to bewilder souls adverse to God consciousness. The deceivers, however, are themselves subject to the greater deception of māyā: &quot;<strong>The killer of the soul, whoever he may be, must enter into the planets known as the worlds of the faithless, full of darkness and ignorance</strong>.&quot; (Śrī Īśopaniṣad, mantra 3)</P>
<P align="center"><img src="http://www.iskcon-truth.com/bhu-mandala/earth-ball-deception/fake-earth3.jpg" alt="" width="588" height="243"></P>
<P>The saṅkīrtana movement of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu is a brief chance in the onward march of Kali-yuga for the soul to take advantage of the Vedic knowledge and to re-establish his eternal relationship with God. The Vedic planetarium is a very important project of the saṅkīrtana movement to enlighten the people in Earth's region of Bhārata-varṣa about their real position in the cosmos, and ultimately about their real home in the Kingdom of God.</P>
<P align="center">UNITING THE UNIVERSE WITH HARINĀMA SAṄKĪRTAN</P>
<P>So let's recap: According to the above description by Mārkaṇḍeya Ṛṣi, there are eight other land areas of Bhārata-varṣa (covering an area of 72,000 miles) somewhere in the vicinity of our known Earth's oceans. Although 'mutually inaccessible' they are not far away. Of course this only makes sense on a flat Earth model with expanded planes. It makes no sense from the perspective of a globe. We shall explain with examples in later posts why this globe image is actually an artificial creation from the special effects department of NASA. We live on a flat Earth, and there is a lot more to be discovered or rather re-discovered. This is the version of the Purāṇas and the one most consistent with the science that proves the Earth is on an expanded flat plane, not a rotating ball in space.</P>
<P align="center"><a href="http://www.iskcon-truth.com/bhu-mandala/bhumandala-jambudvipa/bhu-mandala-seven-islands.png" target="_blank"><img src="http://www.iskcon-truth.com/bhu-mandala/bhumandala-jambudvipa/bhu-mandala-seven-islands.png" alt="Bhū-maṇḍala" width="290" height="303"></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="http://www.iskcon-truth.com/bhu-mandala/bhumandala-jambudvipa/Jambudvipa-rus.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://www.iskcon-truth.com/bhu-mandala/bhumandala-jambudvipa/Jambudvipa-rus_s.jpg" alt="Jambūdvīpa" width="290" height="290"></a></P>
<P>Somehow, we've become separated from the mainland of Jambūdvīpa. The possibility of rediscovering it exists, and it doesn't involve taking spaceships to other Earth-like planets that are similarly floating in space. We do not need rocket ships to find the other regions of Jambūdvīpa because according to Śrīmad Bhāgavatam we are not on a rotating globe-shaped planet at all. We are already standing on part of the flat 800,000 mile circular island of Jambūdvīpa, and are literally only a few thousand miles away on the same stretch of salt water ocean that surrounds our continents from the mainland of Jambūdvīpa. We have difficultly to conceive of this because of the ball Earth concept.The Temple of Vedic planetarium is meant to enlighten the world about the real facts of Kṛṣṇa's creation. As the world becomes purified by Nāma Sankirtan, and the asuric influence in the world is destroyed, I would foresee that a physical connection with Jambudvīpa will be re-established. This is predicted by Śrīla Prabhupāda in the following purport:</P>
<P>&quot;One may raise the question how all three worlds became inundated with love of Kṛṣṇa, since Caitanya Mahāprabhu performed kīrtana only in the Navadvīpa area. The answer is that Lord Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu is Kṛṣṇa Himself. The entire cosmic manifestation results from the Lord's first setting it in motion. Similarly, since the saṅkīrtana movement was first set in motion five hundred years ago by Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu's desire that it spread all over the universe, the Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement, in continuity of that same motion, is now spreading all over the world, and in this way it will gradually spread all over the universe. With the spread of the Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement, everyone will merge in an ocean of love of Kṛṣṇa.&quot; (Śrī Caitanya-caritāmṛta Ādi-līlā 13.32)</P>
<P>&quot;Chaitanya Mahāprabhu's desire that it spread all over the universe, the Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement, in continuity of that same motion, is now spreading all over the world, and in this way it will gradually spread all over the universe&quot;</P>

<P align="center">Natural Boundaries of Antarctica</P>
<P>&quot;<strong>Go beyond borders and cross Antarctica</strong> !&quot;</P>
<P><strong>Whether one likes it or not, or believes in it or not, the horizontal plane model of the Earth is the only one that can accommodate the description of Śukadeva Goswami</strong>. Due to the almost impenetrable propaganda that the Earth is a globe in space, it may seem far-fetched to us now that the Earth actually continues on a vast plane. However, the revelation of Śrīmad Bhāgavatam will provide the impetus for a new science that proves (1) the Earth cannot be a globe; and (2) the Earth is indeed on a horizontal plane. Furthermore, as predicted in Caitanya-caritāmṛta, the sankirtan movement will gradually spread from India, throughout the whole world and across the universe, suggesting that at some point in the future, contact with the other areas of Jambudvīpa may be re-established:</P>
<P>&quot;The saṅkīrtana movement went on from one part of the town to another, as the Lord wandered everywhere performing kīrtana. In this way He inundated the whole world (<strong>tri-bhuvana</strong>—all the three worlds) by distributing love of Godhead. (C.C. Adi 13.32)</P>
<P>PURPORT: One may raise the question how all three worlds became inundated with love of Kṛṣṇa, since Chaitanya Mahāprabhu performed kīrtana only in the Navadvīpa area. The answer is that Lord Śrī Chaitanya Mahāprabhu is Kṛṣṇa Himself. The entire cosmic manifestation results from the Lord's first setting it in motion. Similarly, since the saṅkīrtana movement was first set in motion five hundred years ago by Śrī Chaitanya Mahāprabhu's desire that it spread all over the universe, the Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement, in continuity of that same motion, is now spreading all over the world, and in this way it will gradually spread all over the universe. With the spread of the Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement, everyone will merge in an ocean of love of Kṛṣṇa.&quot;</P>
<P>CHAITANYA MAHĀPRABHU AND THE EARTH OF SEVEN ISLANDS</P>
<P>The sankirtan movement (congregational chanting of the Holy Names of God) inaugurated by Śrī Kṛṣṇa Caitanya Mahāprabhu in West Bengal five hundred years ago is not limited to the world as we know it - the so-called Earth globe. Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu's movement is universal. As explained in the following verses:</P>
<P>&quot;The more the five members of the Pancha-tattva cause the rains of love of Godhead to fall, the more the inundation increases and spreads all over the world (<strong>tri-bhuvane</strong> — all over the three worlds).&quot; Caitanya Caritamrita, Ādi-līlā 7.28</P>
<P>&quot;In the activities of Lord Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, the three worlds dance and chant (<em>tri-bhuvana nāce</em>) having come in touch with love of Godhead. This is the characteristic of His pastimes.&quot; (C.C Antya 3.267)</P>
<P>&quot;Śrī Kṛṣṇa Caitanya Mahāprabhu and His associates of the Pañcha-tattva distributed the holy name of the Lord to invoke love of Godhead throughout the universe (<em>viśva</em>) and thus the entire universe was thankful.&quot; (C.C Adi 7.163)</P>
<P>&quot;The Lord is situated in all the universes in different forms just to please His devotees. Thus the Lord destroys irreligious principles and establishes religious principles.&quot; (CC Madhya 20.219)</P>
<P>Now, what is Now, what is really interesting in Chaitanya Mahāprabhu's pastimes, is that pilgrims from all over the universe would come to meet Him at Jaganatha Purī in India, in order to a pay their homage at His lotus feet, to witness His pastimes of chanting and dancing in ecstatic love of God, and perhaps also to hear some instruction. The Caitanya-caritāmṛta particularly mentions that <strong>pilgrims were coming to see Him from all of the seven islands of Bhū-maṇḍala</strong> (<em><strong>sapta-dvīpa</strong></em>) which would include, of course, our closest neighbours on Jambudvīpa, as well as those from the other khaṇḍas of Bhārata-varṣa:</P>
<P>&quot;Similarly, people who went to Jagannātha Purī from various provinces of India were fully satisfied after seeing the lotus feet of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu.&quot; (C.C Antya-līlā 2.9)</P>
<P>&quot;People from all over the universe, including the seven islands (<em>sapta-dvīpera loka</em>—people from all of the seven islands within the universe), the nine khaṇḍas, the planets of the demigods, Gandharvaloka and Kinnaraloka, would go there in the forms of human beings.&quot; (Śrī Caitanya Caritamrita Antya-līlā 2.10)</P>
<P>Purport: &quot;For an explanation of sapta-dvīpa, see Madhya-līlā, Chapter Twenty, verse 218, and Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam, Fifth Canto, Chapters Sixteen and Twenty.&quot;In the above purport Śrīla Prabhupāda refers us the four chapters of Śrīmad Bhāgavatam that describe the seven islands (sapta-dvīpa) of Bhū-maṇḍala. Thus, there can be no doubt that the verse is explaining that pilgrims from Jambudvīpa and the other islands of Bhū-maṇḍala were coming to visit Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu. In case anyone is any doubt that the seven islands mentioned here are those of Bhū-maṇḍala, in the purport Śrīla Prabhupāda also refers us to Madhya-līlā, Chapter Twenty, verse 218 wherein it is stated:</P>
<P>&quot;Within the universe (brahmāṇḍa-madhye) the Lord is situated in different spiritual manifestations. These are situated on seven islands (sapta-dvīpa) in nine sections (nava-khaṇḍa). Thus Their pastimes are going on.</P>
<P>PURPORT - <strong>The seven islands are mentioned in the Siddhānta-Śiromaṇ</strong>i:</P>
<P>The seven islands (<em>dvīpas</em>) [of Bhū-maṇḍala] are known as (1) Jambu, (2) Śāka, (3) Śālmalī, (4) Kuśa, (5) Krauñca, (6) Gomeda, or Plakṣa, and (7) Puṣkara. The planets are called <em>dvīpa.</em> Outer space is like an ocean of air. Just as there are islands in the watery ocean, these planets in the ocean of space are called <em>dvīpas,</em> or islands in outer space. The continent of Jambūdvīpa forms the innermost concentric island in the above scheme. <strong>Its name is said to derive from a huge Jambū tree</strong>. </P>
<P>There are nine&nbsp;<em>khaṇḍas,</em>&nbsp;known as (1)&nbsp;Bhārata, (2)&nbsp;Kinnara,  (3)&nbsp;Hari, (4)&nbsp;Kuru, (5)&nbsp;Hiraṇmaya,  (6)&nbsp;Ramyaka, (7)&nbsp;Ilāvṛta, (8)&nbsp;Bhadrāśva&nbsp;and  (9)&nbsp;Ketumāla. These are different  parts of the&nbsp;Jambūdvīpa. A valley  between two mountains is called a&nbsp;<em>khaṇḍa</em>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<em>varṣa.</em></P>
<p align="center"><strong><a href="http://www.iskcon-truth.com/bhu-mandala/bhumandala-jambudvipa/bhumandala-map3.jpg" target="_blank"><img class="scale" src="http://www.iskcon-truth.com/bhu-mandala/bhumandala-jambudvipa/bhumandala-map3.jpg" width="579" height="444"></a></strong></p>
<p>&quot;Here the names of the seven islands are listed, including Jambudvīpa. The idea being that residents of Jambudvīpa and the other islands were somehow able to travel from their own regions into our Earth area. Remember these distances cover hundreds of thousands of miles, and the furthest island away (Puskaradvīpa) is some hundreds of millions of miles away. Closer to home, it also mentions the names of the nine <em>khaṇḍas</em> or divisions of Bhārata-varṣa. Again these areas of Bhārata-varṣa stretch over an area of 72,000 miles, and so they are referring to places of the greater Earth that we have not yet discovered. Although we don't know of their existence, pilgrims from those places obviously know of our existence, and in disguise as ordinary humans they came to visit Chaitanya Mahāprabhu in Jagannātha Purī (India) only 500 years ago.</p>
<P>In the purport cited above, Śrīla Prabhupāda refers to the <em>sapta-dvīpa</em> as islands in space, suggesting individual planets, rather than one continual Earth plane. <strong>We have discussed this point in the previous section entitled: Are the Sapta-Dwipa Planets in Space</strong>?</P>
<blockquote>
  <p>This earth planet [Bhū-maṇḍala] is divided into seven dvīpas by seven oceans, and the central dvīpa, called Jambūdvīpa, is divided into nine varṣas, or parts, by eight huge mountains. (<a href="http://vanisource.org/wiki/SB_1.16.12?t=hl#terms=Jamb%C5%ABdv%C4%ABpa" title="vanisource:SB 1.16.12" target="_blank">SB 1.16.12, Purport</a>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>According to Purāṇic cosmography, the world (Bhū-maṇḍala) is divided into seven concentric island continents (<em>sapta-dvipa</em>) separated by the seven encircling oceans, each double the size of the preceding one (going out from within). The seven intermediate oceans consist of salt-water, sugarcane juice, wine, ghee, yogurt, milk and water respectively.</p>
<p align="center"><a href="http://www.iskcon-truth.com/bhu-mandala/bhumandala-jambudvipa/bhumandala-map5.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://www.iskcon-truth.com/bhu-mandala/bhumandala-jambudvipa/bhumandala-map5_s.jpg" alt="The seven islands - dvīpas" width="580" height="432" class="scale"></a> </p>
<p>It is to be understood that all the <em>dvīpas,</em> or islands, are surrounded by different types of oceans, and it is said herein that the breadth of each ocean is the same as that of the island it surrounds. The length of the oceans, however, cannot equal the length of the islands. According to Vīrarāghava Ācārya, the breadth of the first island is 100,000 <em>yojanas. </em>One <em>yojana</em> equals eight miles, and therefore the breadth of the first island is calculated to be 800,000 miles. The water surrounding it must have the same breadth, but its length must be different. (<a href="https://prabhupadabooks.com/sb/5/1/33" target="_blank">sb/5/1/33</a>)</p>
<P>Further verses from Caitanya-caritāmṛta confirm that contact with the other islands on the plane of Bhū-maṇḍala has been on-going; only 500 years ago at Jagannātha Purī in India, Caitanya Mahāprabhu was receiving guests from all over the Bhū-maṇḍala and beyond:&quot;Thus Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu lived at Nīlācala [Jagannātha Purī] with His personal devotees, always merged in ecstatic love for Kṛṣṇa.&quot; (CC Antya-līlā, 9.4)</P>
<P>&quot;People from the three worlds used to come visit Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu. Anyone who saw Him received the transcendental treasure of love for Kṛṣṇa.&quot; (CC Antya-līlā 9.7)</P>
<P>&quot;The inhabitants of the seven higher planetary systems — including the demigods, the Gandharvas and the Kinnaras — and the inhabitants of the seven lower planetary systems [Pātālaloka], including the demons and serpentine living entities, all visited Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu in the dress of human beings.&quot; (CC Antya-līlā 9.8)</P>
<P>&quot;<strong>Dressed in different ways, people from the seven islands (<em>sapta-dvīpa</em>) and nine khaṇḍas (<em>nava</em>-<em>khaṇḍa</em>) visited Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu</strong>.&quot; (CC Antya-līlā 9.9)</P>
<P align="center"><img src="https://www.iskcon-truth.com/bhu-mandala/bhumandala-jambudvipa/bhumandala-chart.png" alt="Seven Dvipas" width="590" height="312"></P>
<P align="left">&quot;Prahlāda Mahārāja, Bali Mahārāja, Vyāsadeva, Śukadeva Gosvāmī and other great sages came to visit Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu. Upon seeing Him, they became unconscious in ecstatic love for Kṛṣṇa.&quot; (CC Antya-līlā 9.10)Again it mentions sapta-dvīpa in verse 9.9. As already explained, the sapta-dvīpa are the islands created on Bhū-maṇḍala by Priyavrata Mahārāja (see SB 5.1.31-33) and include Jambudvīpa. Here it states again that residents from Jambudvīpa were in contact with Chaitanya Mahāprabhu only 500 years ago. In verse 9.10, it mentions that Prahlāda Mahārāja also came to visit Chaitanya Mahāprabhu. Prahlāda Mahārāja is a resident of Hari-varṣa which is on the mainland of Jambudvīpa as described in Chapter 18 of the Fifth Canto of Śrīmad Bhāgavatam. Somehow or other, these residents of <strong>Jambudvīpa and the other islands of Bhū-maṇḍala were able to go back and forth from Bhārata-varṣa</strong>. At present, the residents of Bhārata-varṣa are restricted from entering these areas, but the same restriction does not seem to hold for those outside of Bhārata-varṣa entering into this region.</P>
<P>The verses cited above raise an obvious question: if pilgrims from the 800,000-mile island of Jambudvīpa were coming to see Chaitanya Mahāprabhu in India only 500 years ago, where is this massive Jambudvīpa Island in relation to the so-called Earth globe? How do supporters of the globe explain this? Such a description of pilgrims coming from Jambudvīpa to India certainly creates an elephant in the room for the supporters of the globe idea.</P>
<P>From the above verses, it is clear that in the 15th century when Kṛṣṇa das Kavirāja Goswami wrote the Caitanya-caritāmṛta, that Vaiṣṇavas or devotees of Kṛṣṇa were still referring to the Earth as characterized by seven islands. This seems to be the accepted conception of the Vedic Earth that they believed in. Śrī Caitanya Mahprabhu Himself also speaks of the Earth in these terms:&quot;The sun moves across the zodiac day and night and crosses the oceans between the seven islands one after the other.&quot; (Madhya-līlā 20.387)</P>

<P>In Caitanya-caritāmṛta the words used are <em>sapta-dvīpa-ambudhi</em>, seven islands and oceans. Thus Caitanya-caritāmṛta adheres to the commonly accepted Puranic description of the Earth, and there is otherwise no mention that Earth is globe-shaped. Moreover, the statements from Caitanya-caritāmṛta clearly expound that contact with the greater Earth or Bhū-maṇḍala has been on-going despite knowledge of Bhū-maṇḍala being practically expunged from the consciousness of modern Hindus. <strong>Knowledge of the horizontal plane model of Earth has</strong>, <strong>however</strong>, <strong>continued strongly in the Jain tradition</strong>, despite the lack of awareness in the rest of the world's population who have been indoctrinated into believing that they are on a ball spinning around in dark lonely space.</P>
<P>It is the responsibility of those involved for <strong>the presentations at the Māyāpur Temple of Vedic Planetarium</strong> (<strong>TOVP</strong>) to first comprehend, realize, and then explain the real situation of the great Earth plane. Just as we are taught geography in school, and learn to understand about direction and distance, as well as the names, shapes, and characteristics of other places in the world, so the world should also know about the names, shapes, and characteristics of the places in the greater Earth area as described in Śrīmad Bhāgavatam. This is one of the functions of the TOVP.Again it mentions <em>sapta-dvīpa</em> in verse 9.9. As already explained, the sapta-dvīpa are the islands created on Bhū-maṇḍala by Priyavrata Mahārāja (see SB 5.1.31-33) and include Jambudvīpa. Here it states again that residents from Jambudvīpa were in contact with Chaitanya Mahāprabhu only 500 years ago. In verse 9.10, it mentions that Prahlāda Mahārāja also came to visit Chaitanya Mahāprabhu.

Somehow or other, these residents of Jambudvīpa and the other islands of Bhū-maṇḍala were able to go back and forth from Bhārata-varṣa. <strong>At present, the residents of Bhārata-varṣa are restricted from entering these areas</strong>, but the same restriction does not seem to hold for those outside of Bhārata-varṣa entering into this region.</P>

<P>The verses cited above raise an obvious question: if pilgrims from the 800,000-mile island of Jambudvīpa were coming to see Chaitanya Mahāprabhu in India only 500 years ago, where is this massive Jambudvīpa Island in relation to the so-called Earth globe? How do supporters of the globe explain this? Such a description of pilgrims coming from Jambudvīpa to India certainly creates an elephant in the room for the supporters of the globe idea.A person living in England would be considered ignorant if they did not know something about the geography of the world, and of the existence, distances, directions, etc., of other places in the world like India or America. The world, indeed, was once like that; and even the existence of America was unknown to Europeans before the chance discovery in 1492 by Christopher Columbus. Unfortunately, the people of our modern world are in a similar state of complete ignorance about lands that lay further along, and beyond, our known Earth area. The true feature of the Earth plane is unknown.</P>
<P>Śukadeva Goswami gives the names, measurements, and directions of these other areas from our own Earth area. <strong>Our closest neighbour is a place called Kimpuruṣa-varṣa</strong>, which is further along the northern plane (across the Arctic region), by only a few thousand miles. Śukadeva Goswami describes this in summary. The plane then continues into the other varṣas of Jambudvīpa. The globe model of the Earth cannot accommodate this description. Unfortunately, the head of our present TOVP cosmology department (as of July 2016), due to lacking either the understanding or the faith in this concept, is committed to presenting and explaining the Earth as a globe in space. However, one simple question remains unanswered: If Bhārata-varṣa (where the assumed Earth globe is reputedly situated) is part of Jambudvīpa; where is the rest of the 800,000-mile island of Jambudvīpa described by Śukadeva Goswami? One cannot take the easy way out be saying it must be in another dimension, because Śukadeva Goswami does not describe it as such. It is all within the same dimension. Indeed, we swim in the same salt-water ocean that surrounds the rest of Jambudvīpa. Our oceans, however, form only a fraction of the over-all salt-water ocean, which is a further 800,000 miles in breadth. Again, this conception makes no sense from the description of Earth as a globe in space.</P>
<P>Whether one likes it or not, or believes in it or not, the horizontal plane model of the Earth is the only one that can accommodate the description of Śukadeva Goswami. Due to the almost impenetrable propaganda that the Earth is a globe in space, it may seem far-fetched to us now that the Earth actually continues on a vast plane. However, the revelation of Śrīmad Bhāgavatam will provide the impetus for a new science that proves (1) the Earth cannot be a globe; and (2) the Earth is indeed on a horizontal plane. Furthermore, as predicted in Caitanya-caritāmṛta, the sankirtan movement will gradually spread from India, throughout the whole world and across the universe, suggesting that at some point in the future, contact with the other areas of Jambudvīpa may be re-established:&quot;The saṅkīrtana movement went on from one part of the town to another, as the Lord wandered everywhere performing kīrtana. In this way He inundated the whole world (tri-bhuvana—all the three worlds) by distributing love of Godhead. (C.C. Adi 13.32)</P>
<P>PURPORT: One may raise the question how all three worlds became inundated with love of Kṛṣṇa, since Chaitanya Mahāprabhu performed kīrtana only in the Navadvīpa area. The answer is that Lord Śrī Chaitanya Mahāprabhu is Kṛṣṇa Himself. The entire cosmic manifestation results from the Lord's first setting it in motion. Similarly, since the saṅkīrtana movement was first set in motion five hundred years ago by Śrī Chaitanya Mahāprabhu's desire that it spread all over the universe, the Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement, in continuity of that same motion, is now spreading all over the world, and in this way it will gradually spread all over the universe. With the spread of the Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement, everyone will merge in an ocean of love of Kṛṣṇa.&quot;</P>
