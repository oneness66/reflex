<H3>The Planet Rahu and Distance to the Moon</H3>
<P>Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam <A href="https://prabhupadabooks.com/sb/5/24/24_summary" target="_blank">5.24.24</A> Summary: <STRONG>This chapter describes the planet Rāhu</STRONG>, which is 10,000 yojanas (80,000 miles) below the sun, and it also describes Atala and the other lower planetary systems. <U>Rāhu is situated below the sun and moon</U>. It is between these two planets and the earth. When Rāhu conceals the sun and moon, eclipses occur, either total or partial, depending on whether Rāhu moves in a straight or curving way.</P>
<P>Śrī Śukadeva Gosvāmī said: My dear King, some historians, the speakers of the Purāṇas, say that 10,000 yojanas [80,000 miles] below the sun is <STRONG>the planet known as Rāhu, which moves like one of the stars</STRONG>. The presiding deity of that planet, who is the son of Siṁhikā, is the most abominable of all asuras, but although he is completely unfit to assume the position of a demigod or planetary deity, <U>he has achieved that position by the grace of the Supreme Personality of Godhead</U>. Later I shall speak further about him. (<A href="https://prabhupadabooks.com/sb/5/24/1" target="_blank">sb/5/24/1</A>)</P>
<P>The sun globe, which is a source of heat, extends for 10,000 yojanas [80,000 miles]. The moon extends for 20,000 yojanas [160,000 miles], and Rāhu extends for 30,000 yojanas [240,000 miles]. Formerly, when nectar was being distributed, <STRONG>Rāhu tried to create dissension between the sun and moon by interposing himself between them</STRONG>. Rāhu is inimical toward both the sun and the moon, and therefore he always tries to cover the sunshine and moonshine on the dark-moon day and full-moon night. (<A href="https://prabhupadabooks.com/sb/5/24/2" target="_blank">sb/5/24/2</A>)</P>
<P>PURPORT: As stated herein, the sun extends for 10,000 yojanas, and the moon extends for twice that, or 20,000 yojanas. The word dvādaśa should be understood to mean twice as much as ten, or twenty. In the opinion of Vijayadhvaja,<STRONG> the extent of Rāhu should be twice that of the moon</STRONG>, or text of the Bhāgavatam, Vijayadhvaja cites the following quotation concerning Rāhu; <EM>rāhu-soma-ravīṇāṁ tu maṇḍalā dvi-guṇoktitām</EM>. <STRONG>This means that Rāhu is twice as large as the moon, which is twice as large as the sun</STRONG>. This is the conclusion of the commentator Vijayadhvaja.</P>

<P><STRONG>Rahu and Mohinī-mūrti, the incarnation of the Supreme Personality of Godhead</STRONG></P>
<P>This chapter describes how the demons, being enchanted by the beauty of the Mohinī form, agreed to hand over the container of nectar to Mohinīdevī, who tactfully delivered it to the demigods. (<A href="https://prabhupadabooks.com/sb/8/9/9_summary">sb/8/9/9_summary</A>)</P>
<P>When the demons got possession of the container of nectar, an extraordinarily beautiful young woman appeared before them. All the demons became captivated by the young woman’s beauty and became attached to Her. Now, because the demons were fighting among themselves to possess the nectar, they selected this beautiful woman as a mediator to settle their quarrel. Taking advantage of their weakness in this regard, Mohinī, the incarnation of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, got the demons to promise that whatever decision She might give, they would not refuse to accept it. When the demons made this promise, the beautiful woman, Mohinī-mūrti, had the demigods and demons sit in different lines so that She could distribute the nectar. She knew that the demons were quite unfit to drink the nectar. Therefore, by cheating them She distributed all the nectar to the demigods. When the demons saw this cheating of Mohinī-mūrti, they remained silent<STRONG>. But one demon, named Rāhu, dressed himself like a demigod and sat down in the line of the demigods. He sat beside the sun and the moon</STRONG>. When the Supreme Personality of Godhead understood how Rāhu was cheating, He immediately cut off the demon’s head. Rāhu, however, had already tasted the nectar, and therefore although his head was severed, he remained alive. After the demigods finished drinking the nectar, the Supreme Personality of Godhead assumed His own form.</P>
<P><STRONG>Rāhu, the demon who causes eclipses of the sun and moon</STRONG>, covered himself with the dress of a demigod and thus entered the assembly of the demigods and drank nectar without being detected by anyone, even by the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The moon and the sun, however, because of permanent animosity toward Rāhu, understood the situation. Thus Rāhu was detected.</P>
<P>While Rāhu, in disguise, was drinking nectar among the demigods, the Supreme Personality of Godhead severed his head. Lord Hari, using His disc, which was sharp like a razor, at once cut off Rāhu’s head. <STRONG>When Rāhu’s head was severed from his body, the body, being untouched by the nectar, could not survive</STRONG>.</P>
<P>When the Personality of Godhead, Mohinī-mūrti, severed Rāhu’s head from his body, the head remained alive although the body died. Rāhu had been drinking nectar through his mouth, and before the nectar entered his body, his head was cut off. <STRONG>Thus Rāhu’s head remained alive whereas the body died</STRONG>. This wonderful act performed by the Lord was meant to show that nectar is miraculous ambrosia.</P>
<P><STRONG>Rāhu’s head, however, having been touched by the nectar, became immortal</STRONG>. <U>Thus Lord Brahmā accepted Rāhu’s head as one of the planets</U>. <STRONG>Since Rāhu had become immortal, Lord Brahmā accepted him as one of the <EM>grahas,</EM> or planets</STRONG>, like the moon and the sun. <U>Rāhu, however, being an eternal enemy of the moon and sun, attacks them periodically during the nights of the full moon and the dark moon</U>.</P>
<P>The Supreme Personality of Godhead is the best friend and well-wisher of the three worlds. <STRONG>Thus when the demigods had almost finished drinking the nectar, the Lord, in the presence of all the demons, disclosed His original form</STRONG>.

<H3>Rāhu - the black planet</H3>
<P>TRANSLATION: <STRONG>Considering this, Rāhu, the black planet, covered the full moon</STRONG>, and immediately vibrations of &quot;Kṛṣṇa! Kṛṣṇa! Hari!&quot; inundated the three worlds. PURPORT: According to the <EM>Jyotir-veda,</EM> <U>the Rāhu planet comes in front of the full moon, and thus a lunar eclipse takes place</U>. (<A href="https://prabhupadabooks.com/cc/adi/13/92" target="_blank">cc/adi/13/92</A>)</P>
<P><STRONG>Śrīla Prabhupāda</STRONG>. <STRONG>There are many invisible planets and stars</STRONG>. For example, when the Rāhu planet passes before the sun and moon, there is an eclipse. But the scientists describe an eclipse differently. Actually, the Rāhu planet causes an eclipse. <U>There are many questionable points regarding the modern scientists’ theory of the eclipse. Their explanation is incorrect according to Vedic information</U>. (<A href="https://prabhupadabooks.com/lcfl/16" target="_blank">lcfl/16</A>)</P>
<P><STRONG>Yaśomatīnandana</STRONG>: You don't think, Prabhupāda, they have reached the moon?<BR><STRONG>Prabhupāda</STRONG>: <STRONG>No. There are so many invisible planets</STRONG>. <STRONG>Not that all the stars and planets, you can see, just like Rāhu planet. That is not seen</STRONG>. And when the Rāhu planet passes through, that is eclipse, but they describe in a different way. Actually, it is the Rāhu planet which passes before the sun and moon and there is eclipse. There are so many questionable things of the theory that, the eclipse theory of the modern view. That is not correct according to Vedic theory. (<A href="https://prabhupadabooks.com/conversations/1973/dec/morning_walk/los_angeles/december/10/1973" target="_blank">Lecture December/10/1973</A>)</P>
<P>First of all, whether they are going to the Moon planet, that is doubtful. At least, I am doubtful. Because <STRONG>we get information from the <EM>śāstra </EM>, that there is a planet which is called Rāhu</STRONG>. That is very near to Moon. And that Rāhu sometimes comes in front of the Moon planet, and that is called <EM>candragrahāṇa</EM>. Moon, lunar eclipse. So that, that Rāhu planet is dark. So they might be going to this Rāhu planet, not to the Moon planet. Maybe. Because that is very near. Moon planet is heavenly planet. Heavenly planet. There, there demigods, they live. So we get this information. (<A href="https://prabhupadabooks.com/classes/nod/the_nectar_of_devotion/bombay/december/28/1972" target="_blank">Lecture December/28/1972</A>)</P>
<P><STRONG>Prabhupāda</STRONG>: That... <STRONG>They</STRONG> <STRONG>are not going to the moon planet</STRONG>. They are going to some other planet, Rahu planet. Yes. <U>There are many planets invisible</U>. So there is a Rahu planet which comes in front of the moon planet, and that is called eclipse. So there is a planet rotating. I think they are going to that Rahu planet, <STRONG>not to the moon planet</STRONG>.

<H3>The Earth Shadow ???</H3>
<P><STRONG>Dr. Patel</STRONG>: The modern scientists, the Rahu means other side of the shadow. When the sun shines on the earth, the other side of the earth is, I mean, the night and the shadow of the earth is long, drawn up in the cosmos. And in the view of that shadow, if moon comes, then it is caught by the shadow.</P>
<P><STRONG>Prabhupāda</STRONG>: No, Rahu comes in front...</P>
<P><STRONG>Dr. Patel</STRONG>: That is... The shadow is the Rahu. What else could be? That shadow of earth in the cosmos is the Rahu, most probably to me, because when the moon... Generally moon does not come so very often therein in the purview of that shadow. When it comes, it gets eclipsed.</P>
<P><STRONG>Prabhupāda</STRONG>: No, No. - They give that the earth comes in front of the sun or the moon, therefore the shadow. <U>Our śāstra says that it is Rahu's attack</U>.</P>
<P><STRONG>Prabhupāda</STRONG>: Rahu planet orbit is in between moon and sun. So when it comes in between moon and sun there is eclipse. At night it is eclipse in the moon, and daytime it is eclipse in the sun.</P>
<P><STRONG>Dr. Patel</STRONG>: Now, the earth moves round the sun and the moon moves round the earth…</P>
<P><STRONG>Prabhupāda: No, no.</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>Prabhupāda</STRONG>: No, you do not know what are the movements. You therefore say there are several movements, but you do not know what are these movements. That is not scientific. To avoid the explanation, if the scientist says that there are several movements… But you explain what is that movement? A<STRONG>ccording to our śāstra there is no individual movement. The whole system is moving, making center the polestar. That we can see at night. They have… Star and planet, they have no separate movement.</STRONG> They are fixed up. Just like this tree. There are so many leaves. The tree is moving, so the leaves and twigs, they are moving, not that the leaf is moving.</P>

<H3>The Globular Shadow Theory</H3>
<P>“The Newtonian hypothesis involves the necessity of the Sun, in the case of a lunar eclipse, being on the opposite side of a globular earth, to cast its shadow on the Moon: but, since eclipses of the Moon have taken place with both the Sun and the Moon above the horizon, it follows that it cannot be the shadow of the Earth that eclipses the Moon, and that the theory is a blunder.” -William Carpenter, “100 Proofs the Earth is Not a Globe” (57)<BR><BR>“That the eclipsor of the moon is a shadow at all is assumption--no proof whatever is offered. That the moon receives her light from the sun, and that therefore her surface is darkened by the earth intercepting the sun's light, is not proved. It is not proved that the earth moves in an orbit round the sun, and therefore, by being in different positions, conjunction of sun, earth, and moon, 'Day some-times occur.’ The contrary has been clearly proved--that the moon is not eclipsed by a shadow; that she is self-luminous, and not merely a reflector of solar light, and therefore could not possibly be obscured or eclipsed by a shadow from any object whatever; and that the earth is devoid of motion, either on axes or in an orbit through space. Hence to call that an argument for the earth's rotundity, where every necessary proposition is only assumed, and in relation to which direct and practical evidence to the contrary is abundant, is to stultify the judgment and every other reasoning faculty.” -Dr. Samuel Rowbotham, “Zetetic Astronomy, Earth Not a Globe!” (301)<BR><BR>“According to the globular theory, a lunar eclipse occurs when the sun, earth, and moon are in a direct line; but it is on record that since about the fifteenth century over fifty eclipses have occurred while both sun and moon have been visible above the horizon.” -F.H. Cook, “The Terrestrial Plane”</P>
<P>Sir Henry Holland also noted in his “Recollections” the April 20th, 1837 phenomena where “the moon rose eclipsed before the sun set.” The Daily Telegraph recorded it happening again on January 17th, 1870, then again in July of the same year, and it continues to happen during lunar eclipses to this day. Therefore the eclipsor of the Moon CANNOT be the Earth/Earth's shadow and some other explanation must be sought.</P>

<H3>Vedic Explanation of Solar/ Lunar Eclipses</H3>
<P>PURPORT – According to the Jyotir-veda, <EM>(vedic astrology)</EM> the Rāhu planet comes in front of the full moon, and thus a lunar eclipse takes place. <U>It is customary in India that all the followers of the Vedic scriptures bathe in the Ganges or the sea as soon as there is a<STRONG> lunar or solar eclipse.</STRONG> All strict followers of Vedic religion stand up in the water <STRONG>throughout the whole period of the eclipse and chant the Hare Kṛṣṇa mahā-mantra. </U>At the time of the birth of Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu such a lunar eclipse took place</STRONG>, and naturally all the people standing in the water were chanting Hare Kṛṣṇa, Hare Kṛṣṇa, Kṛṣṇa Kṛṣṇa, Hare Hare Hare Rāma, Hare Rāma, Rāma Rāma, Hare Hare. (<A href="https://prabhupadabooks.com/cc/adi/13/92" target="_blank">CC/adi/13/92</A>)</P>
<P>According to Vedic Astronomy, the most ancient and accurate system of astronomy on the planet, solar eclipses are not caused by the Moon coming in front of the Sun as astronomers believe. Rather the Moon is described as being further away than the Sun and what happens at the time of a solar eclipse is the Moon goes behind the Sun and <STRONG>a dark planet called Rahu comes between the Sun and the Earth</STRONG>. Considering this, Rāhu, the black planet, covered the full moon, and immediately vibrations of “Kṛṣṇa! Kṛṣṇa! Hari!” inundated the three worlds.</P>
<P align="center"><IMG src="http://www.iskcon-truth.com/bhu-mandala/rahu/sun-eclipse2.jpg" width="490" height="349" alt="Solar Eclipse"></P>
<P align="center">“It appears from these verses that aside from the sun and moon,<BR>there is an invisible planet called Rāhu. The movements of Rāhu<BR>cause both solar and lunar eclipses“</P>
<P align="center">SB 4.29.69 - Such observation is not always possible, but it becomes manifest exactly like<STRONG><BR>the dark planet known as Rāhu, which is observed in the presence of the full moon</STRONG>.</P>
<P>&quot;<EM>Though the demon's head was cut off, it was not deprived of life as a result of his having tasted nectar, and, it is said, it assumed the form of a planet. They say that the Dragon's Head (Râhu) being similar in form to the orbs of the luminaries and dark in colour, is not visible in the sky except on the Parvan days (i.e. New and Full Moon). As a result of the Creator's boon Râhu is visible only during eclipses and not on other days</EM>.&quot; (Payer)</P>
<P>In this connection, the darkness occurring before the full moon, the lunar eclipse, can be explained as being another planet, known as Rāhu. According to Vedic astronomy, the Rāhu planet, which is not visible, is accepted. Sometimes the Rāhu planet is visible in the presence of full moonlight. It then appears that this Rāhu planet exists somewhere near the orbit of the moon. The failure of modern moon excursionists may be due to the Rāhu planet. In other words, those who are supposed to be going to the moon may actually be going to this invisible planet Rāhu. Actually, they are not going to the moon but to the planet Rāhu, and after reaching this planet, they come back. (<A href="https://prabhupadabooks.com/sb/4/29/69" target="_blank">SB/4/29/69</A>)</P>

<P><STRONG>Translation</STRONG>: Rāhu’s head, however, having been touched by the nectar, became immortal. Thus Lord Brahmā accepted Rāhu’s head as one of the planets. Since Rāhu is an eternal enemy of the moon and the sun, he always tries to attack them on the nights of the full moon and the dark moon.</P>
<P><STRONG>Purport</STRONG>: Since Rāhu had become immortal, Lord Brahmā accepted him as one of the grahas, or planets, like the moon and the sun. Rāhu, however, being an eternal enemy of the moon and sun, attacks them periodically during the nights of the full moon and the dark moon.

<P><STRONG>Translation</STRONG>: When the spotless moon of Caitanya Mahāprabhu became visible, what would be the need for a moon full of black marks on its body? Considering this, Rāhu, the black planet, covered the full moon, and immediately vibrations of &quot;Kṛṣṇa! Kṛṣṇa! Hari!&quot; inundated the three worlds.</P>
<P><STRONG>Purport</STRONG>: According to the <EM>Jyotir-veda</EM>, the Rāhu planet comes in front of the full moon, and thus a lunar eclipse takes place. It is customary in India that all the followers of the Vedic scriptures bathe in the Ganges or the sea as soon as there is a lunar or solar eclipse.

<P align="center"><IMG src="http://www.iskcon-truth.com/bhu-mandala/rahu/sun-eclipse4.jpg" width="480" height="302" alt="Sun Eclipse"></P>
<P><STRONG>Solar Eclipses are NOT Caused by the Moon</STRONG></P>
<P>According to Srimad Bhagavatam and Vedic Astronomy, the most ancient and accurate system of astronomy on the planet, solar eclipses are not caused by the Moon coming in front of the Sun as western astronomers wrongly believe. Rather the Moon is described as being further away than the Sun and what happens at the time of a solar eclipse is, that a dark planet called Rahu comes between the Sun and the Earth.</P>
<P align="left">On solar/ lunar eclipses what people usuly do, including the so called scientists, is look up in the sky and see what is happening there, <STRONG>but they have no idea</STRONG> how the things are actually working. What they do is they make a <STRONG>speculative theory</STRONG> and test the theory with what they observe and if the theory predicts what they observe they accept that theory and gradually they forget it is just a theory and start stating it as a fact.</P>
<P align="left">The theory that solar eclipses are caused by the moon (or shadow) coming in front of the sun is <STRONG>nothing but a speculative theory only</STRONG>. So called scientists do not know this for a fact. They just presume this is what is happening. And in this case their speculative theory does seem to be be a good possible explanation of what is happening.</P>
<P>But they have no actual information. All they can see is something like a dark planet coming in front of the sun, they presume it is the moon or the shadow. But it can not be the moon if it is dark since the moon has light and illumination. If it is the moon it will be like in a spotlight of reflection from the earth, so it will be illuminated and all the features of the moon will be clearly visible at the time of the eclipse.</P>
<P>So you can test it yourself on any eclipse. Observe the eclipse, if during totality all the features of the moon are clearly visible then this is compatible with the theory that the moon is coming in front of the sun, however if the sun just goes dark then it can not be the moon coming in front of the sun. So observe yourself, if the moon is dark during the eclipse <STRONG>then you have proved that all the scientists in the world are totally wrong</STRONG> about the cause of solar eclipses. This is the scientific process, test the theory and if it fails reject the theory and find a new theory.</P>
<P>Once feared, eclipses are now often eagerly anticipated. Solar eclipses are nowadays major tourist attractions, but in ancient times, they were events of ill omen, to be dreaded and feared. According to Vedic culture, people take bath in sacred rivers or the sea as soon as there is a lunar or solar eclipse. So especially they go to Kurukṣetra, a pilgrimage.</P>
<P>In USA millions of foolish people will &nbsp;gaze thru their “special glasses” <STRONG>at the solar eclipse</STRONG>. In some towns people are driving in from thouands of miles away just to view this “event”. <STRONG>They want to have a party while the sun is eclipsed by Rahu the demon</STRONG> who had his head cut off by Lord Vishnu. Even with ordinary common sense, if the suns rays, which gives life to the entire solar system is being blocked, <U>one should think-how can this be good?</U>? But because <STRONG>these foolish people</STRONG> are being guided by equally or more ignorant people (the so called scientists) their misfortune only increases.</P>
<P align="center"><IMG src="http://www.iskcon-truth.com/bhu-mandala/rahu/sun-eclipse5.jpg" width="580" height="366"></P>
<H3>The Planet Rahu and Eclipses</H3>
<P>After hearing from the sun and moon demigods about Rāhu’s attack, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Viṣṇu, engages His disc, known as the Sudarśana cakra, to protect them. The Sudarśana cakra is the Lord’s most beloved devotee and is favored by the Lord. The intense heat of its effulgence, meant for killing non-Vaiṣṇavas, is unbearable to Rāhu, and he therefore flees in fear of it. <STRONG>During the time Rāhu disturbs the sun or moon, there occurs what people commonly know as an eclipse</STRONG>. (<A href="https://prabhupadabooks.com/sb/5/24/3" target="_blank">sb/5/24/3</A>)</P>
<P>PURPORT: Although Rāhu attempts to attack both the sun and the moon, they are protected by Lord Viṣṇu. Being very afraid of Lord Viṣṇu’s <EM>cakra,</EM> Rāhu cannot stay in front of the sun or moon for more than a <EM>muhūrta</EM> (forty-eight minutes). The phenomenon that occurs when Rāhu blocks the light of the sun or moon is called an eclipse. <U>The attempt of the scientists of this earth to go to the moon is as demoniac as Rāhu’s attack. Of course. their attempts will be failures because no one can enter the moon or sun so easily. Like the attack of Rāhu, such attempts will certainly be failures</U>.</P>

<P><STRONG>Rahu in different Cultures</STRONG><BR>In many cultures, the darkening of the sun or moon forebodes misfortune and evil. Even today, an eclipse is considered inauspicious and a bad omen in many cultures. Eclipses were believed to be caused by a celestial dragon trying to devour the sun during an eclipse.</P>
<P>Rahu still hates the Sun and Moon gods for the destruction of his body from the neck down, and he attacks the Sun and Moon out of revenge, following a schedule of eclipses, which are predicted and recorded to this day by astronomers and astrologers.</P>
<P>In the Indian culture a solar eclipse is &nbsp;believed to be the result of Rahu, the dark planet, chasing the Sun and moon, trying to devour them. Rahu, angry at the Sun and Moon, for being denied his share of amrita (the celestial nectar), pursues them through the sky and swallows one or the other. Since Rahu has no body, the sun or moon will reappear after passing his mouth, coming out through his disconnected neck.</P>

<P><STRONG>China: Sun-Eating Dragon</STRONG><BR>A celestial dragon in the sky eating up the Sun explains the Chinese word for eclipse, which is (re shi), meaning ‘sun eat’. The ancient Chinese believed that solar eclipses occur when a legendary celestial dragon devours the Sun. They also believed that this dragon attacks the Moon during lunar eclipses. It was a tradition in ancient China to bang drums and pots, use firecrackers or even shoot arrows into the sky, all in an effort to frighten away the dragon. Even more recently, in the nineteenth century, the Chinese navy fired its cannons during a lunar eclipse to remember the old custom.</P>

<P><STRONG>Thailand: Phra Rahu - God of eclipse</STRONG><BR>Phra Rahu, the God of Darkness, is worshiped at many temples throughout Thailand, the most famous of which is Wat Srisathhong in Nakhon Pathom Province. Phra Rahu was formerly a Demon God who the Thais believe took the form of a serpent. Colored black, with only an upper body and head, he holds a golden orb to his mouth, the golden orb is said to be the sun. To ward off bad luck associated with Rahu's attempts to devour the sun, believers make offerings of black objects.</P>

<H3>Rahu in astrology</H3>
<P>Devanagari: राहु Affiliation: Graha, Asura, Demon. Rahu is one of the navagrahas (nine planets) in Vedic astrology. The Rahu kala is considered inauspicious. Rahu and Ketu are considered to be the two parts of the demon Rahu lying axially in opposite directions and dividing the zodiac in two equal parts.</P>
<P>The vedic scriptues explain that Rahu and Ketu are dark planets (only visible on eclipses) with specified orbits, they can not be seen by modern telescopes. Astronomically, Rahu and Ketu denotes the two points of intersection of the paths of the Sun and the Moon as they move on the celestial sphere. Therefore, Rahu and Ketu are respectively called the north and the south lunar nodes.</P>
<P>Although Rahu is generally considered bad and inauspicious, it is not always tha case. In vedic Astrology Rahu is considered good when Rahu forms an auspicious position in the horoscope and the native is in a profession suited to Rahu, it can enable him/her to reach great heights. If Rahu-Ketu are seated in good positions in their own nakshatra (constellation), they may give good results to the native. In short, Rahu is not always malefic. If it becomes strong in the horoscope, then it can make the person fulfill his deepest desires and ambitions to rise high!</P>
<P align="center"><IMG src="http://www.iskcon-truth.com/bhu-mandala/rahu/rahu-astrology.png" width="590" height="424" alt="Rahu Ketu"></P>
<P><STRONG>The Matsya Purana states</STRONG>:<BR>&quot;The following are the nine planets, viz.—the Sun, the Moon, the Mars, the Mercury, the Jupiter, the Venus, the Saturn, the<STRONG> Rahu</STRONG> and the <STRONG>Ketu</STRONG>. <STRONG>They always bring good to all creatures (to call some of them malignant, is a mere mode of speech).</STRONG>&quot; <EM>(Matsya Purana 93.11)</EM> <STRONG>Note</STRONG>: in Vedic Astrology Rahu and Ketu are called <EM>upa-grahas</EM>, &quot;non-luminous&quot; shadow planets. </P>
<P>&quot;Since all the planets are working to reform the living entities whether through punishment or reward, <STRONG>they must be considered as bringing about good, even though to our perception it appears that Rahu is inauspicious</STRONG>. Rahu is part of the Sisumara and is offered obeisances in the Vedic mantras.&quot; Since Rahu and Ketu are part of the Sisumara-Chakra they are considered celestial stars.</P>
<P>Amar Puri: &quot;The functional nature of each and every STARS in the natal chart does differ and so is their influence owing to their respective placement at each and every Human being taking birth in a certain time and place on this planet earth. Therefore, the STAR like Saturn is not always considered EVIL.</P>
<P>The functional nature of Rahu and Ketu always play materially disturbance in order to teach the importance of the Religious principles for ALL the Living being a lesson to cultivate Spiritual life going Back Home – Back to Godhead eventually.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;In his wife Siṁhikā, Vipracitti begot one hundred and one sons,<STRONG> of whom the eldest is Rāhu and the others are the one hundred Ketus</STRONG>. All of them attained positions in the influential planets.&quot; (<A href="https://prabhupadabooks.com/sb/6/6/37" target="_blank">sb/6/6/37</A>)</P>

<h3 align="center">Rahu never actually swallows the Sun and Moon </h3>
<P align="left">The Chinese Sun-Eating Dragon or Rahu devouring the Sun and Moon are just analogies and metaphors for common people, who have no knowledge of the planetary system of the cosmos.</P>
<p><span lang="EN-GB">Although the Puranas sometimes describe that Rahu swallows the Sun and Moon during an eclipse, <strong>the acharyas mention that Rahu is always 10,000 yojana (80,000 miles) below the height of the Sun, and thus does not ever touch these celestial planets</strong>. The Sun and Moon are protected from Rahu’s attack by Sri-Krishna’s chakra weapon: </span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-GB">“The revolving Sudarshan chakra stays there and Rahu faces it for some time but is unable to bear it, thus he withdraws. This position is called an eclipse. The Sun and the Moon are wholly or partly covered according to the different positions of Rahu. <strong>Rahu does not devour either of them as they are in different orbits</strong> (Commentary by Sridhara Svami 5.24.3)</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-GB">“The partial or total eclipse depends upon the position of Rahu, upright or slanted. <strong>He does not actually touch either of them as he is very far away from them</strong>”. (Commentary by Viraraghava SB 5.24.3)</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-GB">“Rahu covers the Sun’s or Moon’s disc as he rushes to fight with them. This phenomenon is called an eclipse. Rahu’s position is far off; thus he will never touch either of them”. (Commentary by Sri Bhagavatprasadacarya SB 5.24.3)</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-GB">“The partial or full coverage depends upon the position of Rahu. <strong>He does not come into physical contact with them as he is 10,000 yojana (80,000 miles) away</strong>”. (Commentary by Visvanatha Cakravarti Thakura)</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-GB"> Another point I brought up is that the Rahu shadow is seen sometimes moving from left to right across the Sun, whereas the Moon always moves right to left in the sky. How can the solar eclipse be caused by the passing of the Moon when the Moon always moves right to left, not left to right. </span></p>

<p>"<strong>O Sudarśana wheel, you are religion, you are truth, you are encouraging statements, you are sacrifice, and you are the enjoyer of the fruits of sacrifice. You are the maintainer of the entire universe, and you are the supreme transcendental prowess in the hands of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.

<p>Set into motion by the Supreme Personality of Godhead and wandering in all the four directions, the disc of the Supreme Lord has sharp edges as destructive as the fire of devastation at the end of the millennium.

<p>Mahārāja Ambarīṣa said: <strong>O Sudarśana cakra, you are fire, you are the most powerful sun, and you are the moon, the master of all luminaries.

 Srila Prabhupada explains an eclipse, Rahu and<BR>
 position of the moon according to Vedic texts</STRONG><BR>
<A href="http://vanisource.org/wiki/Morning_Walk_--_October_25,_1975,_Mauritius?t=hl#terms=In the Sahara desert we can have life there, SwamijÄ«" target="_blank">Morning Walk -- October 25, 1975, Mauritius</A>:</P>
<P><STRONG>Prabhupāda</STRONG>: (Break)...beyond the sun.</P>
<P><STRONG>Indian man</STRONG>: Beyond the sun. How would you explain about eclipse which we get?<BR><STRONG>Prabhupāda</STRONG>: That you ask some astronomer. I am not astronomer. But I understand from Vedic scripture that moon is beyond the sun.</P>
<P><STRONG>Indian man</STRONG>: 'Cause we have seen that the moon comes between...<BR><STRONG>Prabhupāda</STRONG>: Yes, eclipse, it is Rahu. It is Rahu between the sun and, sun and moon. Yes.</P>
<P><STRONG>Indian man</STRONG>: Between the earth and the sun.<BR><STRONG>Prabhupāda</STRONG>: No earth. No, Rahu. Earth is...</P>
<P><STRONG>Cyavana</STRONG>: What they see is Rahu, not moon. No.</P>
<P><STRONG>Indian man</STRONG>: At night the planets which give light to this universe...<BR><STRONG>Prabhupāda</STRONG>: That is moon.</P>
<P><STRONG>Indian man</STRONG>: Moon.<BR><STRONG>Prabhupāda</STRONG>: Yes. They say that every planet gives light. That is not fact.</P>
<P><STRONG>Indian man</STRONG>: The reflection I think, of the sun...<BR><STRONG>Prabhupāda</STRONG>: No, there is fire.</P>
<P><STRONG>Indian man</STRONG>: In the moon too there is fire? But it is cold, as the, our sages say.<BR><STRONG>Prabhupāda</STRONG>: It is surrounded by cooling atmosphere.</P>
<P><STRONG>Indian man</STRONG>: It rotates?<BR><STRONG>Prabhupāda</STRONG>: In a different way, not as they explain.</P>
<P><STRONG>Indian man</STRONG>: They rotate.<BR><STRONG>Prabhupāda</STRONG>: Just like my hands is moving... (break) ...like that.</P>
<P><STRONG>Indian man</STRONG>: And it does not go all around other planets?<BR><STRONG>Prabhupāda</STRONG>: No.</P>
<P><STRONG>Cyavana</STRONG>: They all move together?<BR><STRONG>Prabhupāda</STRONG>: Yes.<BR><STRONG>Cyavana</STRONG>: They move together?</P>
<P><STRONG>Prabhupāda</STRONG>: Yes. The pivot is the polestar. Fixing, the pole-star, they are moving like this. And there is sun's movement. So we shall go once again?<BR><STRONG>Cyavana</STRONG>: Yes. We can go back.</P>
<P><STRONG>Prabhupāda</STRONG>: You do not know what are the movements. You therefore say there are several movements, but you do not know what are these movements. That is not scientific. To avoid the explanation, if the scientist says that there are several movements… But you explain what is that movement? A<STRONG>ccording to our śāstra there is no individual movement. The whole system is moving, making center the polestar. That we can see at night. They have… Star and planet, they have no separate movement.</STRONG> They are fixed up. Just like this tree. There are so many leaves. The tree is moving, so the leaves and twigs, they are moving, not that the leaf is moving.</P>
<P><STRONG>Indian man</STRONG>: (break)...friend, and I told him that you said these things. So he asked me the question about the eclipse. So I would like to know to explain to him about it.<BR><STRONG>Prabhupāda</STRONG>: The eclipse is... When the Rahu comes between sun and moon, there is eclipse.</P>
<P><STRONG>Indian man</STRONG>: It does not eclipse the moon. But why people say that it's the moon that covers the sun? Because they don't know it's...<BR><STRONG>Prabhupāda</STRONG>: They are misinformed.</P>
<P><STRONG>Indian man</STRONG>: They suppose?<BR><STRONG>Prabhupāda</STRONG>: It is not the fact.</P>
<P><STRONG>Indian man</STRONG>: Astronomers too say that.<BR><STRONG>Prabhupāda</STRONG>: It is up to the man to believe or not believe, but we have got authorities, different; they have got authorities, different. So if we follow our authorities, then we have to accept according to that.</P>
<P><STRONG>Indian man</STRONG>: We get in a dilemma, we people who do not know more than they explain about.<BR><STRONG>Prabhupāda</STRONG>: There is no dilemma, because our literature is there from millions and millions of years, and they have their knowledge within two, three hundred years. Now it is up to us whom to believe.</P>
<P><STRONG>Indian man</STRONG>: You want to say that the astronomers are the mistaken. The astronomers have been mistaken to say all these things?<BR><STRONG>Prabhupāda</STRONG>: Yes. Everyone commits mistake. Anyone who is conditioned, he must commit mistake. This is our position, that anyone who is not liberated, he must commit mistake. We take knowledge from liberated soul, not from the speculators. That is the difference.</P>
<P><STRONG>Cyavana</STRONG>: They prove their inadequacy by changing their theories every twenty years.<BR>
<STRONG>Prabhupāda</STRONG>: Yes.</P>
