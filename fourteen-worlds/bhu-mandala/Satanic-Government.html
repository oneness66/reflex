<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;At the present, especially on this planet earth, the influence of Lord Brahma has decreased considerably, <STRONG>and the representatives of Hiranyakashipu—the Rakshasas (man-eaters) and demons—have taken charge. </STRONG>Therefore there is no protection of brahminical culture and cows, which are the basic prerequisites for all kinds of good fortune. <STRONG><EM>This age is very dangerous because society is being managed by demons and Rakshasas. </EM>&quot; </STRONG><EM>(SB 7.3.13)</EM></P></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>The following paper is a consideration of COVID-19 in the context of Srila Prabhupada's revelatory message to the world. During the course of his world-wide preaching, Srila Prabhupada had on numerous occasions made the extraordinary claim that the Earth had been overrun by a demoniac presence, and that Krishna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead in the form of transcendental sound vibration (the Hare Krishna Maha-mantra) had incarnated upon the Earth in order to curb the advance of the <EM>asuras</EM> (demons), and to bring about a golden age of Krishna consciousness.</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;So <STRONG>when there is satanic influence</STRONG> over the kingdom of God, or the devotees, or the appointed demigods, <EM>they are disturbed by satanic influence, then Krishna comes… </EM>That is stated, confirmed, in <EM>Bhagavad-gita</EM>. <EM>yada yada hi dharmasya glanir bhavati bharata abhyutthanam adharmasya tadatmanam srjamy aham </EM>[Bg. 4.7] Whenever there is discrepancies in the discharge of natural laws of God, then God incarnates. <STRONG>Either He incarnates Himself, or He sends His bona fide representative, or He sends His powerful representative.&quot; </STRONG><EM>(Caitanya-caritamrta Madhya-lila 20.154-157, December 7 1966 New York)</EM></P></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>(For some of Srila Prabhupada's many statements on this matter, see appendix 1 to this paper.)</P>
<P>Although the words Satan and 'satanic' are more commonly used in Christian terminology, they are words that Srila Prabhupada used frequently and interchangeably with the Sanskrit word <EM>asura</EM> (demoniac). Srila Prabhupada spoke of the 'satanic government' (SB 4,9.66 purport), the 'satanic influence' (SB 2,2,17 purport), the 'satanic situation' (<EM>Sri Isopanishad</EM>, mantra 10), the 'satanic consciousness' <EM>(Room Conversation, July 23 1973, London) </EM>, etc. At the current time, the 'satanic influence' is orchestrated by a demoniac personality called Kali who presides over the present age of Kali-yuga (see section below called The Satanic Government). Please note that the personified Kali-yuga is an <EM>asura</EM>, and not to be confused with Goddess Kali whose role is to slay <EM>asuras</EM>.</P>
<P>In Christian usage, the name Satan refers to the leader of the evil demons. Satan is considered to be the ruler of Hell, and also is believed to be the seductive force that leads people into sin, and away from God. Interestingly, the Vedic cosmology explains that the hellish regions are actually ruled by demigods, not by demons. In the Vedic tradition, hell is described as the universe's prison department, not as the stronghold of evil demons—though the hell itself is certainly staffed by terrifying beings who inflict terrible punishment on others. In the Vedic tradition, imprisonment in hell is not for eternity, and a soul is eventually released after suffering the reactions for sinful activity.</P>
<P>Though the Vedic tradition does not have an exact equivalent of Satan/Lucifer, there are many similar satanic or demoniac beings such as the personality of Kali, who presides over the present age of Kali-yuga (the Age of Fighting and Hypocrisy). Like Satan, Kali leads people into sin, and away from God. We shall discuss more of Kali later, though it should be emphasized from the start that no demoniac personality is ever a contending force to the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Sri Krishna remains in all circumstances the supreme controller, and the demoniac beings are allowed to operate within the limited sphere of the material world due to a complex interplay of free-will, desire, and karma.</P>
<P>Though Srila Prabhupada generally used the word 'satanic' interchangeably with the word <EM>asura</EM> (demoniac), he sometimes also used the word interchangeably with <EM>maya</EM> (the great illusion). Though goddess Durga (the personified illusion) is a servant of God, and not a demoniac being, those souls who develop the false ego of wanting to be the <EM>Ishvara</EM> (controller) are cast into her realm of illusion (the material world). Srila Prabhupada defines the 'satanic mentality' as follows:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;Dvitiya means a secondary existence beyond God which is, in Bible, it is said, Satan and God. So this satanic mentality has made them under the control of material nature. Satanic mentality. <STRONG>What is that satanic mentality? That &quot;I want to be God.&quot; Always thinking falsely, &quot;I am God,&quot; or &quot;Independent,&quot; &quot;I can do anything, everything,&quot; &quot;Whatever I survey, I am the lord of whatever I survey.&quot; </STRONG>These foolish things are going on.&quot; <EM>(Caitanya-caritamrta Madhya 20.119-121, New York, November 24, 1966)</EM></P></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>Sri Krishna describes the demoniac mentality as one who thinks: <EM>isvaro 'ham aham bhogi</EM>, &quot;I am the Lord of everything. I am the enjoyer&quot; <EM>(Bg 16.14) </EM>In the following lectures, Srila Prabhupada equates the satanic mentality with being in <EM>maya</EM> (illusion). Illusion (<EM>maya</EM>) captures anyone who gives up the position of being a servant of God:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;The aim of life is how to regain our God consciousness, or Krishna consciousness, and love Him. <STRONG>Because we do not love God, therefore we have been obliged to love maya, Satan.&quot; </STRONG><EM>(SB 1.2.9, Detroit, August 3, 1975)</EM></P></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>Again:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;There are two things: God or Satan. So similarly, God is Krishna, and Satan is maya. <STRONG>So if you refuse to serve God, then you have to serve Satan. </STRONG>That's all. You cannot become master&quot;. <EM>(SB 6.1.40, San Francisco, July 21 1975)</EM></P></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>Again:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><STRONG><FONT face="verdana" size="2">&quot;As soon as the living entity forgets his position as eternal servant of God, and he wants to imitate God to enjoy, at that time, maya, illusion, or Satan captures him, captures him&quot;.</STRONG> <EM>(Conversation with Cardinal Danielou, August 9, 1973)</EM></P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>Srila Prabhupada's statement that &quot;if you refuse to serve God, then you have to serve Satan&quot;, is really quite a revelation. Srila Prabhupada candidly explained in the following conversations that we are the evil, and the extent of evil is only a question of degree:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Ramesvara: We say that Krishna is all good.<BR>Prabhupada: Yes.<BR>Ramesvara: And then the materialist says, &quot;If Krishna is all good, then how is there any evil?&quot;<BR>Prabhupada: <STRONG>Evil is you.</STRONG><BR>Ramesvara: But everything comes from Krishna.<BR>Prabhupada: Yes. Everything comes from.... Yes. If.... You have created a situation. So for your satisfaction, Krishna has given you the chance, but that is evil, what you have created.<BR>Ramesvara: But I have this propensity because I am part of Krishna.<BR>Prabhupada: Yes. When you come under maya, you have got so many propensities. <STRONG>So as soon as you disobey Krishna, the maya is there. </STRONG><EM>Krishna-bahirmukha hana bhoga vancha kare nikata-stha maya tare japatiya dhare (Prema-vivarta) </EM>, immediately. Just like darkness and light. <STRONG>As soon as you give up light, you come to darkness. There is no second alternative.</STRONG><BR><EM>(Morning Walk, June 3 1976, Los Angeles)</EM></P></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>Again:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Mother: But what I'm trying to say is there's more evil in the world than goodness.<BR>Prabhupada: Yes. Unless there is evil, why you are in this material world? <STRONG>You have accepted evil. Therefore you are in this material world. </STRONG>And if you accept God, the good, then you are in the spiritual world. <STRONG>You don't accept God; you want evil. Therefore you are in the material world. Just like in the jail, prison house, who are they? They are all criminals. Similarly, every one of us who are within this material world, they are all criminals because they have disobeyed the order of God. </STRONG>In different status only, but they are all criminals. Because every one of them is subjected to the rules of nature: birth, death, old age, and disease.<BR><EM>(Room Conversation, May 14 1975 Perth)</EM></P></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>Although everyone within the material world is more or less under the influence of maya, there exists a division between those who still recognize the authority of God and try their best to serve His will, and those who do not:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;There are two classes of men always. One is called devata, godly, and the other is called demon, <EM>asura</EM>. <STRONG>Or satanic. </STRONG>Whatever you call, the two classes. So those who are God conscious, they are godly. And those who have no God consciousness, they are demonic, or satanic. So these two classes of men are always there. <STRONG>But at the present moment, the number of demonic or satanic consciousness, they have increased. </STRONG>Yes. So the symptoms of the demonic people are described in the <EM>Bhagavad-gita</EM>.&quot; <EM>(Room Conversation, July 23 1973, London)</EM></P></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>These two forces are always in contention:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;Simply you have to employ your energy for Krishna. That is expected by Krishna. And what will be the result? The result will be, at least individually you shall be peaceful, you shall be happy. If everyone becomes like that, in Krishna consciousness, or everyone tries to apply his energy for the service of the Lord, then this world becomes kingdom of God actually. But that is not possible. <STRONG>Here there is another opposing element, which is called maya, or Satan, who is acting against this principle. </STRONG>So we cannot expect that cent percent people will be God conscious or Krishna conscious. That is not possible because here in this material world... This material world means it is a place where maya is predominant. Maya is predominant means the forgetfulness of God is predominant&quot;. <EM>(SB 6.1.6, Los Angeles, January 3, 1970)</EM></P></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>In the above conversation (London 1973), Srila Prabhupada explained that due to the Age of Kali, the number of <EM>asuras</EM> has increased in the world. Despite the presence of the 'satanic consciousness' in all aspects of life, the influence is generally so insidious and covert, that an innocent person may not be aware that they are participating in, administering, serving, and protecting a system and culture that is essentially Satanic.</P>
<P><STRONG>MARCH 2020, THE MONTH WHEN THE WORLD STOPPED</STRONG></P>
<P>For conditioned souls who identify the self with the body, who have little or no spiritual knowledge or realization, and who are generally absorbed in the materialistic conception of life, Srila Prabhupada's message that a 'satanic influence' or 'satanic consciousness' is presently directing the world's governments, economy, military, science, religion, etc., is of such supernatural magnitude that it is not easily received, understood, appreciated, accepted, or assimilated—even by his own followers. In the 45 years since Srila Prabhupada's departure, people through-out the world have routinely gone to school or university, to places of work or business, to temples, churches, and mosques, to restaurants, rock concerts, and other places of entertainment, to the gym, yoga class, or other sporting facilities, they have gone shopping as usual, traveled around the world, watched the news and movies on television, participated in social media, followed sporting and cultural events, they have had sex, raised children, looked after the old, buried the dead, they have gone to parties and got drunk, danced, and sang, and done all the things that people normally do; and as people went about their everyday business there seemed to be no overt reason to think that any great spiritual battle was taking place, that the world had fallen under the rule of a demoniac or satanic power, or that 'God' had manifested on the Earth to save everyone from the threat. Now, as the world grinds to a halt in the face of the COVID-19 scare, the entire world waits with bated breathe to understand what it is all about, and of course, what comes next.</P>
<P>What goes by the name of the COVID-19 pandemic has caused a unique situation in the history of the world because it is the first time that all nations in the world are collectively brought to a complete standstill, and that all people, <EM>at the same time</EM>, face the same threat of impending death. It is an existential crisis that involves practically every member of the world. The fact that all the people of the world have been simultaneously forced to 'stop', surely signals that a reset is being made, and that a major change in the world is coming. The short term changes of this reset are more likely to be worse than better for most people, but the long term changes will eventually bring an end to the present satanic system (see Sri Nammalvars predictions below).</P>
<P><STRONG>THE BOARD GAME OF LIFE</STRONG></P>
<P>From the perspective of Vaishnavism, neither <EM>devas</EM> (demigods empowered by Sri Krishna to control of nature) or <EM>asuras</EM> (demons who contend for control of nature) can control anything unless Sri Krishna allows the move to be made:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;This material nature, which is one of My energies, is working under My direction, O son of Kunti&quot; <EM>(Bg 9.10)</EM></P></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>In <EM>Srimad Bhagavatam</EM> Sri Krishna is compared to the player who moves the pieces on the board game of conditioned life:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;As a player sets up and disperses his playthings according to his own sweet will, so the supreme will of the Lord brings men together and separates them.&quot; <EM>(SB 1.13.43)</EM></P></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>Accepting Srila Prabhupada's statement that the world is presently run by <EM>asuras</EM>, and that the incarnation of Godhead has appeared in the form of the Holy Name (the Hare Krishna Maha-mantra) to address the situation, let us try and understand the present circumstance of COVID-19 hysteria in the light of the above verse which compares all the people in the world to pieces on a board game, and which describes Sri Krishna as the player who is moving the pieces here and there according to their destiny.</P>
<P>Is the present world-wide 'lock-down' a responsible reaction by the concerned governments of the world to the impending threat of a catastrophic natural disaster (<EM>adhidaivika</EM>); or is COVID-19 (a particular strain of flu that is not likely to kill any more than the estimated 350,000-650,000 people who normally die from flu every year) simply a smokescreen for a further phase of an ingenious demoniac (<EM>adhibhautika</EM>) takeover? I personally believe the latter to be the case; but in either case, the point I wish to emphasize here is that whatever happens in this world, it is simply Sri Krishna moving pieces on the board game of life.</P>
<P>Followers of <EM>Srimad Bhagavatam</EM> and Srila Prabhupada cannot rule out the possibility that <EM>asuras</EM> are intent on controlling the world (such an attempt was made only 5,000 years ago); nor can they rule out the possibility that the <EM>asuras</EM> will resort to any cruel or deceptive strategy in order to gain their end. Sri Krishna says that the <EM>asuras</EM> &quot;engage in unbeneficial, horrible works meant to destroy the world&quot; (Bg 16.9). Illegal accumulation of wealth <EM>(Bg 16.11) </EM>, and killing come naturally to a demon:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;The demoniac person thinks: &quot;So much wealth do I have today, and I will gain more according to my schemes. So much is mine now, and it will increase in the future, more and more. He is my enemy, and I have killed him, and my other enemies will also be killed&quot;. <EM>(Bg 16.13-14)</EM></P></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>Sri Krishna also sounds a warning regarding the <EM>asura </EM>nature: <EM>na satyam tesu vidyate</EM>, 'nor truth is found in them', <EM>(Bg 16.7) </EM>. This is an important statement to bear in mind when taking in information from the media regarding COVID-19. Who controls the media?</P>
<P>Lets take the extreme position that the COVID-19 hysteria whipped up by the world's government and media is not simply a very human reaction to an impending world-wide natural disaster, but is actually a smokescreen for <EM>asuras</EM> to gain further control over the world's people and resources. As mentioned earlier, it is my own understanding that this is indeed the case; however, the present format of Sampradaya Sun is not the place to argue the specific details for such a position. I leave it to the reader to do their own research and come to their own conclusion. In this paper I simply wish to explain why members of the Krishna consciousness movement should understand the COVID-19 event in the context of Srila Prabhupada's warning that the world is presently controlled by Rakshasas (the 'satanic government'), and also why the devotees of Sri Krishna should not naively trust the official narrative, or blindly accept the so-called remedial measures to the 'pandemic'. Regarding the word 'pandemic', according to the World Health Organization's official statistics, up to 650,000 people normally die every year from flu, yet it is never before been called a 'pandemic', or regarded as a cause for a world lock-down. There is much to say regarding the official narrative, but here is not the place.</P>
<P>[NB: Whilst employing Srila Prabhupada's term 'satanic government', we do not wish to say that every member of the world government is an <EM>asura</EM>. Just as Krishna places devotees like Bali Maharaja, Prahlada Maharaja, Vibhisana (Ravana's brother), etc., in the camp of the <EM>asuras</EM>, we can likewise understand that Krishna has his own agents strategically placed within the current <EM>asura</EM> leadership. Conversely, just as <EM>asuras</EM> such as Pralamba, Putana, etc., enter in disguise into the camp of the religious, so we should expect many <EM>asuras</EM> to be posing as religious leaders through-out the world—ISKCON included. <EM>Much discernment is needed</EM>]</P>
<P>As pieces on the board game called life, it is often disconcerting to see those who are cruel, merciless, and deceptive <EM>asuras</EM> gain the upper hand in the game, and indeed seeming to be in control of the board. Unbeknownst to the <EM>asuras</EM>, however, is the understanding that Sri Krishna knows the outcome of this particular game before it even began. The <EM>asuras</EM> are unwittingly facing Sri Krishna's checkmate from the very beginning, but since it takes a number of moves before any checkmate can take place, the <EM>asuras</EM> are allowed to make this and that move, and to capture a piece here and another piece there. Such moves never actually catch Sri Krishna by surprise. Sri Krishna knows every move that the <EM>asuras</EM> will make before its even been made, because any move that the <EM>asuras</EM> are allowed to make is simply part of Krishna's arrangement for the unfolding of a complex interaction of free will, desire, and karma. Sri Krishna knows that every move the <EM>asuras</EM> make is just a move closer to their own inevitable and destined defeat.</P>
<P>Before the outbreak of fighting on the battle-field of Kuruksetra, Sri Krishna told the dispirited Arjuna:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;Therefore get up. Prepare to fight and win glory. Conquer your enemies and enjoy a flourishing kingdom. <STRONG>They are already put to death by My arrangement, and you, O Savyasaci, can be but an instrument in the fight.&quot; </STRONG><EM>(Bg 11.33)</EM></P></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>Though Duryodana and company had been allowed to make this and that move against the Pandavas, depriving them of their kingdom, etc., the defeat of the <EM>asuras</EM> who had incarnated on the Earth at that time was destined from the beginning. Likewise for those <EM>asuras</EM> who are incarnate on the Earth at this time, and who are intent on using the COVID-19 (or any other disaster) to further their own ends, let all be assured that Sri Krishna has His own plans in action, and that any hidden evil will be eventually exposed to the world, with the resulting karma coming back on the head of the evil-doers:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;Though his hatred is concealed by deception, his wickedness will be exposed in the assembly. He who digs a pit [to trap others] will fall into it, and he who rolls a stone [to crush others] will have it roll back on him&quot;. <EM>(Proverbs 26.26-27)</EM></P></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>Whatever the immediate result of the COVID-19 —whether the asuric world government are allowed to make another gain on the chess board of life, or whether their nefarious deeds will be dramatically exposed—the end result will be the inevitable defeat of satanic government. The unfolding strategy of Sri Krishna Chaitanya Mahaprabhu will eventually checkmate and defeat satanic government.</P>
<P>Just as Krishna assured Arjuna that his victory over the <EM>asuras</EM> was a forgone conclusion, similarly, there are many assurances from Sri Krishna Chaitanya Mahaprabhu and his associates that the present asuric system will be entirely annihilated.</P>
<P><STRONG>A DIVINE PROPHECY: SRI NAMMALVAR'S PREDICTIONS ON LORD CHAITANYA</STRONG></P>
<P>Sri Nammalvar who appeared at the very beginning of Kali-yuga is the incarnation of Lord Sri Visvaksena, the commander in chief of the Vaikuntha world. In his prophetic poetry, Nammalvar predicted the Golden Avatari, Sri Krishna Chaitanya Mahaprabhu, and also described the Golden Avatar's Sankirtan Movement that would utterly destroy the present satanic system. The following translations are from a A Divine Prophecy: Sri Nammalvar's Predictions on Lord Chaitanya by Sridhara Srinivasa dasa (2017)</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;The Lord of Vaikuntha has incarnated as His devotee(s). He is miraculously present everywhere and his incomparable and unsurpassed acitivities alone occupy my vision. <STRONG>Have no doubts if you are born as <EM>asuras</EM> or rakshasas, engrossed in sense gratification there is no way for you to live and will certainly be destroyed.&quot; </STRONG><EM>(Tiruvaimoli 5.2.5)</EM></P></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>In the above verse, Sri Nammalvar describes miraclous events (<EM>mayattinal engum manni</EM>) which is beyond comparison (<EM>okkindra tivvula gattu</EM>) which will destroy the asuric presence (<EM>uyiium vagaiyillai tondir</EM>). As quickly as the <EM>asuras</EM> can wreak chaos and destruction in the world, so the Lord can 'miraculously' restore it.</P>
<P>In the next verse Nammalvar describes the great changes that will come in the world:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;The Supreme Lord, the holder of the Sudarshana disc, has come himself in the form of His devotees <STRONG>to rid the world of the soul-consuming disease, war, hunger, and evil. </STRONG>He is traveling all over the world. Singing in joy and dancing. O worldly minded people cease your engagemnsts in sense gratification, go worship him with full consciousness and dedicate your life and soul.&quot; <EM>(Tiruvaimoli 5.2.6)</EM></P>
<P><STRONG><FONT face="verdana" size="2">The ill-effects of Kali-yuga have ceased and a new golden age of sankirtan-yajna has begun. </STRONG>The demigods have also joined the movement and the whole world is flooded with love of Godhead. The devotees of Kadalvannan have entered and occupied every corner of the Earth and are singing the name, fame and the glories of the Lord with great joy and enchantment.&quot; <EM>(Tiruvaimoli 5.2.3)</EM></P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P><STRONG>THE GOLDEN AVATARI</STRONG></P>
<P>Sri Krishna Chaitanya Mahaprabhu once manifested his form of Varaha to Murari Gupta affirming that he would again protect the Earth and destroy the <EM>asuras</EM>:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;I accepted the incarnation of Varaha to lift the material world out of the waters of nescience. Know Me to be the ultimate goal of the Vedas. The purpose of My present incarnation is to propagate the congregational chanting of the Holy Names of Krishna. <STRONG>In this incarnation, as in other incarnations, I will annihilate the miscreants for the protection and pleasure of My devotees.&quot; </STRONG><EM>(Sri Chaitanya Bhagavata, Madhya-kanda, chapter 3)</EM></P></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>Sri Krishna Chaitanya Mahaprabhu again personally declared:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;I have appeared in this incarnation to kill the demons <EM>[pashandis</EM>] and, after killing them, to preach the cult of devotional service.&quot; <EM>(Caitanya-caritamrta, Adi-lila 17.53)</EM></P>
<P>PURPORT</P>
<P>Lord Caitanya's mission is the same as that of Lord Krishna, which He states in the <EM>Bhagavad-gita</EM> (4.7–8):</P>
<P>&quot;Whenever and wherever there is a decline in religious practice, O descendant of Bharata, and a predominant rise of irreligion—at that time I descend Myself. <STRONG>In order to deliver the pious and to annihilate the miscreants, as well as to re-establish the principles of religion, </STRONG>I advent Myself millennium after millennium.&quot;</P>
<P>As explained here, the real purpose of an incarnation of Godhead is to kill the atheists and maintain the devotees. He does not say, like so many rascal incarnations, that atheists and devotees are on the same platform. Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu, or Lord Sri Krishna, the real Personality of Godhead, does not advocate such an idea. Atheists are punishable, whereas devotees are to be protected. To maintain this principle is the mission of all avataras, or incarnations...Of course Lord Caitanya is described as the most merciful incarnation of Godhead and His desire is to engage all the living entities in his blissful sankirtan movement.&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>Srila Prabhupada explains here that whenever an incarnation of Godhead appears the mission is to save the pious and annihilate the miscreants. Since the Supreme Personality of Godhead has now manifested in the form of Nama Avatara (the Hare Krishna Maha-mantra), we can live assured in the faith that the present asuric regime will be eventually destroyed. There is no question that it will continue to exist. Nama Avatara will re-establish dharma by first removing <EM>asuras</EM> from positions of power, and then placing dharmic leaders in all aspects of society. Once dharma is restored, nature will function as normal, and the vision of Sri Nammalvar will manifest: &quot;The Supreme Lord, the holder of the Sudarshana disc, has come himself in the form of His devotees to rid the world of the soul-consuming disease, war, hunger, and evil&quot;... <STRONG>'The ill-effects of Kali-yuga have ceased and a new golden age of sankirtan-yajna has begun'.</STRONG></P>
<P>In later papers we shall explain the connection between the appearance of Sri Krishna Caitanya Mahaprabhu's Sankirtan Movement, the destruction of the present world satanic system, and the revealing of the true size and shape of the Vedic Earth, via the Mayapur Temple of Vedic Planetarium. Though our continuing discussion of Bhu-mandala may seem rather abstract and somewhat irrelevant in the midst of the COVID-19 'crisis', the understanding of the true shape, size, and nature of the Earth is actually a necessary part of seeing through the present illusions and deceptions of the satanic government; it is also a major part of the great spiritual transformations in the world that will eventually reconnect our own world to other civilizations through-out the greater Earth. From Sri-dhama Mayapur, in India, the Sankirtan Movement has already begun to spread throughout the Bhu-mandala, and throughout the universe as predicted in the following verses:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;The more the five members of the Pancha-tattva cause the rains of love of Godhead to fall, the more the inundation increases and spreads all over the world (<EM>tri-bhuvane</EM>—all over the three worlds).&quot; <EM>(Caitanya-caritamrta, Adi-lila, 7.28)</EM></P>
<P>&quot;In the activities of Lord Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu, the three worlds dance and chant (tri-bhuvana nace) having come in touch with love of Godhead. This is the characteristic of His pastimes.&quot; <EM>(Caitanya-caritamrta, Antya-lila, 3.267)</EM></P>
<P>&quot;Sri Krishna Caitanya Mahaprabhu and His associates of the Pancha-tattva distributed the holy name of the Lord to invoke love of Godhead throughout the universe (vishva) and thus the entire universe was thankful.&quot; <EM>(Caitanya-caritamrta, Adi, 7.163)</EM></P>
<P>&quot;The Lord is situated in all the universes in different forms just to please His devotees. Thus the Lord destroys irreligious principles and establishes religious principles.&quot; <EM>(Caitanya-caritamrta, Madhya 20.219)</EM></P></BLOCKQUOTE>

  will cause the entire universe <br>

<P>Before His appearance in the world as Sri Krishna Chaitanya, Lord Krishna told his associates about His future plan:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;I shall personally inaugurate the religion of the age—nama-sankirtana, the congregational chanting of the holy name. I shall make the world (bhuvana) dance in ecstasy, realizing the four mellows of loving devotional service.&quot; <EM>(Sri Caitanya-caritamrta Adi-lila, 3.19)</EM></P></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>Despite the darkness of the times, we are about to enter an era of unprecedented love in the world. The desire of Lord Krishna to extend his love to the living entities has been declared, and it is only a question of time before the world changes in a radical and fundamental way. In a lecture delivered in 1974, the young disciples of Srila Prabhupada cheered in jubilation as he delivered the following words of assurance:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;So Krishna comes here, as it is stated in the <EM>Bhagavad-gita</EM>, <EM>paritranaya sadhunam vinashaya ca duskrtam</EM> [Bg. 4.8]...Whenever there will be demons, Krishna will come. <STRONG>At the present moment, now, the world is full of demons. Therefore Krishna has come in the form of Hare Krishna.</STRONG></P>
<P>Devotees: Hare Krishna.</P>
<P>Prabhupada: <STRONG>That is Krishna avatara. Kali-yuge nama-rupe avatara. So don't think that Krishna, this vibration Krishna, is different from that Krishna. The same Krishna. The same Krishna…All the demons, full of sinful activities, they are to be delivered by this weapon, Hare Krishna.</STRONG><BR><EM>(Srimad Bhagavatam 1.16.23 Los Angeles, July 13, 1974)</EM></P></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P><STRONG>THE RESTORATION OF DHARMA</STRONG></P>
<P>We should not take the above statements cited statements from Nammalvar regarding the end of 'war, hunger, disease, and evil' as Utopian. We live in an age of such abnormality that the history of a normally functioning society is considered as fantasy; however the following statements from <EM>Srimad Bhagavatam</EM> give us hope that the world will again be restored to order when the Lord's empowered representatives appear:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;During the reign of Maharaja Yudhisthira, the clouds showered all the water that people needed, and the earth produced all the necessities of man in profusion. Due to its fatty milk bag and cheerful attitude, the cow used to moisten the grazing ground with milk. The rivers, oceans, hills, mountains, forests, creepers and active drugs, in every season, paid their tax quota to the King in profusion. Because of the King's having no enemy, the living beings were not at any time disturbed by mental agonies, diseases, or excessive heat or cold.&quot; <EM>(SB 1.10.4-6)</EM></P>
<P>Purport: Unless one is pious and recognized by the Lord, he cannot make others happy who are under his care. There is full cooperation between man and God and man and nature, and this conscious cooperation between man and God and man and nature, as exemplified by King Yudhisthira, can bring about happiness, peace, and prosperity in the world. The attitude of exploiting one another, the custom of the day, will only bring misery.&quot; <EM>(SB 1.10.6)</EM></P></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>Again:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><STRONG><FONT face="verdana" size="2">&quot;When a Vaishnava king like Dhruva Maharaja is the head of the government of the entire world, the world is so happy that it is not possible to imagine or describe. Even now, if people would all become Krishna conscious, the democratic government of the present day would be exactly like the kingdom of heaven. </STRONG>If all people became Krishna conscious they would vote for persons of the category of Dhruva Maharaja. If the post of chief executive were occupied by such a Vaishnava, all the problems of satanic government would be solved. The youthful generation of the present day is very enthusiastic in trying to overthrow the government in different parts of the world. But unless people are Krishna conscious like Dhruva Maharaja, there will be no appreciable changes in government because people who hanker to attain political position by hook or by crook cannot think of the welfare of the people. They are only busy to keep their position of prestige and monetary gain. They have very little time to think of the welfare of the citizens.&quot; <EM>(SB 4.9.66)</EM></P>

<P>Again:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;When Lord Ramacandra, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, was the King of this world, all bodily and mental suffering, disease, old age, bereavement, lamentation, distress, fear, and fatigue were completely absent. There was even no death for those who did not want it. <EM>(SB 9.10.53)</EM></P>
<P>PURPORT</P>
<P>All these facilities existed because of Lord Ramacandra's presence as the King of the entire world. A similar situation could be introduced immediately, even in this age called Kali, the worst of all ages. It is said, kali-kale nama-rupe krishna-avatara: Krishna descends in this Kali-yuga in the form of His holy name—Hare Krishna, Hare Rama. If we chant offenselessly, Rama and Krishna are still present in this age. The kingdom of Rama was immensely popular and beneficial, and the spreading of this Hare Krishna movement can immediately introduce a similar situation, even in this Kali-yuga.&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>Sri Krishna's auspicious appearance on the Earth is recorded by Queen Kunti:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;O Gadadhara [Krishna], our kingdom is now being marked by the impressions of Your feet, and therefore it appears beautiful. But when You leave, it will no longer be so. All these cities and villages are flourishing in all respects because the herbs and grains are in abundance, the trees are full of fruits, the rivers are flowing, the hills are full of minerals and the oceans full of wealth. And this is all due to Your glancing over them.&quot; <EM>(SB 1.8.39-40)</EM></P></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>Srila Prabhupada states:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;Therefore the prajas, or the people in general, must take to the Krishna consciousness movement, <STRONG>the Hare Krishna movement, which is the sound incarnation of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. <EM>Kali-kale nama-rupe krishna-avatara</EM>: Krishna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, has now appeared as an incarnation by His holy name. </STRONG>Therefore, when the prajas become Krishna conscious, they can then expect a good government and good society, a perfect life, and liberation from the bondage of material existence.&quot; <EM>(SB 9.15.15 Purport)</EM></P></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P><STRONG>SATANIC GOVERNMENT AND DISEASE</STRONG></P>
<P>One of the many indicators that help us understand the asuric nature of the present world leadership, and why the Lord has appeared at this time, is the presence of so many unnatural disturbances in the form of floods, storms, fires, earthquakes, and of course, 'diseases'. One can compare the auspicious conditions of nature at the time of Krishna's appearance (SB 10.3.1-5) to that of the inauspicious conditions at the time of the appearance of demons like Hiranyaksa and Hiranyakasipu (<EM>SB 3.17.1-15</EM>). One can also compare the above descriptions of life under Vaishnava kings with the conditions under our present leadership. COVID-19 would not occur during the reign of Yudhisthira or Prithu or any other Vedic King. The fact that such diseases occur is an indication that the present leadership in the world is indeed asuric, and not to be trusted in finding a 'cure' for a disease which is nothing other than a reaction to the policies caused by their own asuric leadership.</P>
<P>One could say that <EM>janma-mrtyu-jara-vyadhi</EM> (<EM>BG 13.9</EM>) are a natural part of life, and that the presence of disease (<EM>vyadhi</EM>) does not imply that the present leadership in the world is <EM>asura</EM>; however the overwhelming prevalence of disease (<EM>vyadhi</EM>) at the present time is symptomatic of <EM>adharma </EM>in the world, a situation that is almost absent during the reign of <EM>dharmic</EM> kings. The cancer industry for example has more to profit from the cancer disease than it has in presenting the cure. One can refer to the excellent documentary by Ty Bollinger called <EM>The Truth About Cancer</EM> to see how truly demoniac the so-called health industry actually is. The personified diseases belong to the camp of the <EM>asuras</EM>, and they manifest when dharma declines. When dharma is restored, the personified diseases find no place in the society. We have already read in the predictions by Sri Nammalvar that the sankirtan movement will &quot;rid the world of the <STRONG>soul-consuming disease</STRONG>, war, hunger, and evil&quot;.</P>
<P>As with all avatars of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the mission is to eradicate <EM>adharma </EM>and restore <EM>dharma </EM>(<EM>Bg 4,8-9</EM>). Since it is also Sri Krishna Chaitanya Mahaprabhu's desire to restore dharma via the Sankirtan Movement, a new golden age will certainly manifest in due course of time. The golden age of Krishna consciousness, however, is not simply an external upcoming event; it is something that can occur at any time depending on one's level of Krishna consciousness:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;The holy, unholy and mixed persons exist in all the yugas. <STRONG>To those that are holy, all the yugas are the Satya yuga; </STRONG>to the unholy ones always it is the Kali yuga (Dark age); and to the mixed ones, always it is Treta and Dvapara&quot;. <EM>(Devi Purana 4.5.6)</EM></P></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P><STRONG>WHAT IS A DEMON?</STRONG></P>
<P>Before continuing to elaborate on the theme of the satanic government, we must first understand that designating a particular group as <EM>asuras</EM> or satanic or demoniac is not intended to create a strict duality of good and evil beings. Sri Krishna Chaitanya Mahaprabhu (the great teacher) taught that all living beings are eternally the servant of Krishna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Thus even though one may be temporarily designated as a demon, the original soul or spiritual form (<EM>sva-rupa</EM>) of every single living being is eternally connected to Krishna in a relationship of loving service:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><EM><FONT face="verdana" size="2">jivera 'svarupa' haya—krishnera 'nitya-dasa</EM>: &quot;It is the living entity's (<EM>jivera</EM>) constitutional position (<EM>sva-rupa</EM>) to be an eternal servant (<EM>nitya-dasa</EM>) of Krishna (<EM>krishnera</EM>).&quot; <EM>(Caitanya-caritamrta, Madhya 20.108)</EM></P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>Again:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><EM>nitya-siddha krishna-prema 'sadhya' kabhu naya sravanadi-suddha-citte karaye udaya</EM></P>
<P>&quot;Pure love for Krishna (krishna-prema) is eternally established (<EM>nitya-siddha</EM>) in the hearts of the living entities. It is not something to be gained from another source. When the heart is purified by hearing and chanting, this love naturally awakens.&quot; <EM>(Chaitanya Charitamrta, Madhya-lila 22.107)</EM></P></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>Since love for Sri Krishna (krishna-prema) is eternal and perfect (nitya-siddha), it is nothing more than an illusion that we don't love Krishna. An <EM>asura</EM> or demon is simply a soul who is in deeper and darker illusion regarding their their true identity and relationship with Sri Krishna. The good qualities of the eternal soul are simply covered over due to being conditioned by the material energy in which we all struggle. Sri Krishna states:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;The living entities in this conditioned world (<EM>jiva-loke</EM>) are My (<EM>mama</EM>) eternal (<EM>sanatanah</EM>) fragmental parts (<EM>amshaha</EM>). Due to conditioned life, they are struggling very hard with the six senses, which include the mind&quot;. <EM>(BG 15.7)</EM></P></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>Since every living entity is part and parcel of Sri Krishna, all living beings (including those temporarily designated as demons) have the innate good qualities of Sri Krishna Himself. The good qualities are simply covered over due to association with the modes of nature. Sri Krishna uses the word 'covered' (<EM>avrtah</EM>) many times in his teachings to Arjuna when describing the situation of the conditioned soul within the material world:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;Embodied beings are bewildered because of the ignorance which covers their real knowledge&quot; <EM>(Bg 5.15)</EM></P>
<P><EM><FONT face="verdana" size="2">ajnanena</EM> —by ignorance; <EM>avrtam</EM> —covered; <EM>jnanam</EM> —knowledge; <EM>tena</EM> —by that; <EM>muhyanti</EM> —are bewildered; <EM>jantavah</EM> —the living entities.</P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>Again:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;Thus the wise living entity's pure consciousness becomes covered...&quot; <EM>(Bg 3.39)</EM></P>
<P><EM><FONT face="verdana" size="2">avrtam</EM> —covered; <EM>jnanam</EM> —pure consciousness; <EM>etena</EM> —by this; <EM>jnaninah</EM> —of the knower</P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>Many times in his preaching Srila Prabhupada gave the example that Sri Krishna is like the sun and the living entities are like the sunshine, meaning that both Krishna and the living entities are eternally glorious, brilliant, and shining. However, just as the sunshine can be covered by a cloud, so the small living entity can sometimes be covered by the cloud of illusion causing them to act in ignorance of the spiritual reality. In keeping with the analogy we should understand that the dark cloud does not make the sunshine dark, it simply covers the bright sunshine which is always there in the background, and simply waiting to be revealed again once the cloud passes. Likewise, although the modes of material nature may cause the living entity to appear evil or demoniac, the innate and eternal glory, purity, and holiness of every soul will be revealed in due course of time. Just as a cloud can cover sunshine and then disperse again, so too will the bright sunshine of every soul be revealed once more.</P>
<P>The good qualities of every soul are simply covered over due to association with the modes of nature. A precious jewel is still a precious jewel even if it falls in the mud and appears to be covered in dirt. When the jewel is cleansed of the dirt, it resumes its innate brilliance. In a similar way, all the brilliant souls are like jewels who are simply covered by different modes of nature which causes ignorance in some, and passion in others. Though the modes of nature cover the original nature of the soul, they do not change or modify the original and immutable qualities of the soul.</P>
<P>Every soul is a 'civilized soul' (a precious jewel) in their original position. Understanding these points, a person with spiritual vision will not take the negative side of another person's conditioned behaviour as the ultimate reality—a soul designated as demon is just a player in the drama being played out on the stage of the material world. We are so many actors playing parts according to the script of our present karma and desire. As the real appearance and character of actors is covered by a costume, so everyone's real spiritual character and appearance is covered by the dress of the material body and mind.</P>
<P>The following is from Srila Prabhupada's book called the <EM>Perfection of Yoga</EM> :</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;A person is said to be still further advanced when he regards all—the honest well-wisher, friends and enemies, the envious, the pious, the sinner and those who are indifferent and impartial—with an equal mind.&quot; <EM>(Bg. 6.9)</EM></P>
<P>There are different kinds of friends. There is suhrit, who is by nature a well-wisher and is always desiring one's welfare. Mitra refers to an ordinary friend, and udasina is one who is neutral. In this material world someone may be my well-wisher, friend or neither friend nor enemy but neutral. Someone else may serve as a mediator between me and my enemies, and in this verse he is called madhya-stha One may also see someone as pious and another as sinful according to his own calculations. But when he is situated in transcendence, all of these—friends, enemies or whatever—cease to exist. <STRONG>When one becomes actually learned, he does not see any enemy or any friend because in actuality &quot;no one is my enemy, no one is my friend, no one is my father, no one is my mother, etc.&quot; We are all simply living entities playing on a stage in the dress of father, mother, children, friend, enemy, sinner and saint, etc. It is like a great drama with so many characters playing their parts. However, on the stage a person may be an enemy or whatever, but off the stage all the actors are friends. </STRONG>Similarly, with these bodies we are playing on the stage of material nature, and we attach so many designations to one another. I may be thinking, &quot;This is my son,&quot; but in actuality I cannot beget any son. It is not possible. At the utmost I can only beget a body. It is not within any man's power to beget a living entity. Merely by sexual intercourse a living entity cannot be begotten. The living entity must be placed in the emulsification of secretions. This is the verdict of Srimad-Bhagavatam. Thus all the multifarious relationships between bodies are just so much stage play. One who is actually realized and has actually attained yoga no longer sees these bodily distinctions.&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>Sri Krishna Caitanya Mahaprabhu, who is Krishna Himself in His most merciful incarnation, taught that chanting the Hare Krishna mantra will awaken every soul from their dream-like condition in the world of <EM>maya</EM>. It is Sri Krishna Chaitanya Mahaprabhu's mission to deliver all souls from the spell of <EM>maya</EM> including those poor souls who are deeply and darkly immersed in the satanic culture:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;I have advented to propagate the congregational chanting of the holy names of God, and with this I will deliver this sinful material world. <STRONG>Those demons and evil forces who never accepted My authority and Lordship, will weep in joy in this age by chanting My names. </STRONG>I will vigorously distribute in this age such extraordinary devotional service, which is sought after even by demigods, sages and perfected beings, that even the most abominable sinners, dogeaters, untouchables, and women will receive it. But those who, becoming intoxicated with education, wealth, family background and knowledge, criticize and offend My devotees I deprive of everything, and they can never know My true identity. I declare truly that My name will be preached in every town and village of this earth.&quot; <EM>(Chaitanya Bhagavata, Antya-lila, chapter 4)</EM></P></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>Sri Krishna Chaitanya Mahaprabhu and Sri Nityananda Prabhu are the saviours of the most fallen and their love and mercy extends to one and all without discrimination. But this does not mean that they will allow the demoniac or satanic culture to prevail and flourish. <EM>The Lord's mercy will be shown by slaying the Beast, and restoring one and all to their original position as lovers of Krishna.</EM></P>
<P>When King Bali was deprived of his kingdom by Sri Krishna in the form of Vamanadeva, he said to the Lord:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;Since Your Lordship is indirectly the greatest well-wisher of us demons, You act for our best welfare by posing as if our enemy. Because demons like us always aspire for a position of false prestige, by chastising us You give us the eyes by which to see the right path&quot;. <EM>(SB 8.22.5)</EM></P></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>Likewise the wives of Kaliya said to Sri Krishna:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;The wives of the Kaliya serpent said: The punishment this offender has been subjected to is certainly just. After all, You have incarnated within this world to curb down envious and cruel persons. You are so impartial that You look equally upon Your enemies and Your own sons, for when You impose a punishment on a living being You know it to be for his ultimate benefit&quot;. <EM>(SB 10.16.33)</EM></P>
<P>What You have done here is actually mercy for us, since the punishment You give to the wicked certainly drives away all their contamination. Indeed, because this conditioned soul, our husband, is so sinful that he has assumed the body of a serpent, Your anger toward him is obviously to be understood as Your mercy.&quot; <EM>(SB 10.116.34)</EM></P></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>In the present struggle with satanic government we should always retain equal vision as Sri Krishna Himself is equal to all:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;The Supreme Personality of Godhead, in His feature of eternal time, is present in the material world and is neutral towards everyone. No one is His ally, and no one is His enemy. <EM>(SB 4.11.20)</EM></P>
<P>Purport: Since Lord Narayana is absolute, His transcendental qualities are described as one. Thus His punishments and His offerings of favor are both of the same value. Essentially, His inimical actions are not displays of enmity toward His so-called enemies, but in the material field one thinks that Krishna is favorable to devotees and unfavorable to nondevotees. <EM>(SB 7.1.3)</EM></P></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>Again:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;The conditioned soul has friends and enemies. He is affected by the good qualities and the faults of his position. The Supreme Lord, however, is always transcendental. Because He is the Ishvara, the supreme controller, He is not affected by duality. It may therefore be said that He sits in the core of everyone's heart as the neutral witness of the causes and effects of one's activities, good and bad. We should also understand that <EM>udasena</EM>, neutral, does not mean that He takes no action. Rather, it means that He is not personally affected. For example, a court judge is neutral when two opposing parties appear before him, but he still takes action as the case warrants.&quot; <EM>(SB 6.16.11 Purport)</EM></P></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>Although Sri Krishna is neutral and loves everyone, He still takes action to curb the <EM>asuras</EM> (whilst remaining unaffected by the duality of conflict). Sri Krishna's transcendental position is really quite amazing. One difficulty we face in the world of duality is how to deal with right and wrong, whilst simultaneously remaining neutral, and not falling down into the lower modes of envy and hatred. Sri Krishna does not find anyone undesirable, despicable, or to be neglected:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;The Supreme Lord has no favorite and no dearmost friend, nor does He consider anyone undesirable, despicable, or fit to be neglected. All the same, He lovingly reciprocates with His devotees in whatever manner they worship Him, just as the trees of heaven fulfill the desires of whoever approaches them&quot;. <EM>(SB 10.38.22)</EM></P></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>Indra again explains that Sri Krishna's punishment is not partial but is for the good of all. Indra said:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;You are the father and spiritual master of this entire universe, and also its supreme controller. You are insurmountable time, imposing punishment upon the sinful for their own benefit. Indeed, in Your various incarnations, selected by Your own free will, You act decisively to remove the false pride of those who presume themselves masters of this world.&quot; <EM>(SB 10.27.6)</EM></P>
<P>PURPORT</P>
<P>The word <EM>hitaya</EM> is significant here. Lord Krishna protects religion and chastises the wicked for the benefit of the entire universe. Foolish and faithless pseudopriests criticize God for punishing the living entities through the actions of nature. But whether Lord Krishna punishes them indirectly through nature or directly in His incarnations, as mentioned here, He has a perfect right to do so because He is the father, spiritual master and supreme ruler of the entire universe. Another way He curbs down the false attempts of the conditioned souls to establish the kingdom of God without God is through His feature as insurmountable time. It is said, &quot;Spare the rod and spoil the child.&quot; That is a fact, and it is actually the Lord's mercy that He takes the trouble to rectify our misbehavior, although faithless persons criticize the Lord's fatherly vigilance.&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>If the incarnation of Godhead appears to deliver the pious and annihilate the miscreants (as the above verses state), why is the satanic system still standing when the Sound Incarnation of Godhead is already manifest in the world? Although both <EM>devas </EM>and <EM>asuras</EM> are present in the world, we have not yet seen the Lord's showdown with the satanic system. This is because Sri Krishna Chaitanya Mahaprabhu is allowing the <EM>asuras</EM> some time to associate with the purifying effects of the Sankirtan Movement. As dawn is neither night nor day, but is an amazing mixture of light and darkness, so we live in an amazing time when forces of good and evil, light and darkness, are similarly mixed together. This temporary arrangement allows for a complex interplay of free will, the fulfillment of specific desires associated with the satanic culture (illicit sex, drugs, meat-eating, gambling, etc.), and, of course, the working out of some heavy karma. But just as the dawn signals the inevitable end of the night, so the appearance of the Sankirtan Movement signals the beginning of the end of the satanic system. As the great well-wisher of all living entities, Srila Prabhupada brought a message of hope and deliverance even for the <EM>asuras</EM>. Sri Krishna Chaitanya Mahaprabhu will certainly destroy the satanic system, but not without bringing auspiciousness to the <EM>asuras</EM> first.</P>
<P><STRONG>CALCULATING THE DARKER SIDE</STRONG></P>
<P>One may wonder why all this talk of demons is necessary in the present context of a COVID-19 pandemic. Who are the demons?</P>
<p align="center"><a href="http://www.harekrsna.com/sun/editorials/04-20/sg2.png" target="_blank"><img src="http://www.harekrsna.com/sun/editorials/04-20/sg2.png" alt="Demoniac Gargoyle" width="580" height="435"></a></p>
<P>In a lecture on <EM>Bhagavad-gita</EM> given in 1973, Srila Prabhupada whilst discussing the battle strategy of the Pandavas and Kauravas gave his followers the following instruction:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;Then Duryodhana, first of all he pointed out the military strength of the opposite side. This is intelligence. One should take calculation of the opposing elements or the enemy's side. In fighting the first thing is to take estimation of the enemy's side, how much they are strong, how they have arranged. Then one should calculate how to counteract, how to fight with them, this is intelligence. Without taking any calculation of the other side, if you are not prepared, then how you can become victorious? This is sane proposal, that is, <EM>upayan cintayet prajno apayan ca cintayet</EM>. <STRONG>A <EM>prajna</EM>, an intelligent man, not only think of the bright side on this business, or this fight, or this any..., so many things we have to deal with. Simply we should not calculate the brighter side. There is darker side also. We should always think, &quot;If there is some thief, if there is some rogue, they cheat us, then what precaution I am going to take?&quot; This is intelligence. </STRONG>If I simply calculate that &quot;In this business I will make so much profit.&quot; In the meantime, somebody comes and cheats me and go away, then... Therefore <EM>upayan cintayet prajna apayan ca cintayet</EM>. <STRONG>Darker side also should be thought of. That is intelligence. Just like they are doing. After calculating the darker side—enemy means darker side—they can defeat me at any moment. That is darker side.&quot; </STRONG><EM>(Bhagavad-gita 1.6-7 London July 11 1973)</EM></P></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>The <EM>Srimad Bhagavatam</EM> names the prevailing leader of the 'dark side' as the demon Kali (not to be confused with goddess Kali who is a servant of Krishna). The personality of Kali is a <EM>maha-asura</EM> who presides over this Age of Kali-yuga, and he is endowed with supernatural power to cause spiritual degradation in the world. We must bear in mind that all functions in the universe whether good or bad are connected to a supernatural personality. The idea is expressed in the Christian New Testament:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;For we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high places.&quot; <EM>(Ephesians 6:12)</EM></P></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>Just as <EM>devas</EM> preside over functions like sun, moon, water, air, fire, knowledge, fortune, etc., along with qualities like truthfulness, compassion, fame, satisfaction, etc, likewise, each sinful activity and quality has a presiding demon, and by meditating upon or engaging in a sinful activity one becomes connected to that demoniac personality.</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;Another son of Lord Brahma was Irreligion, whose wife's name was Falsity. From their combination were born two demons named Dambha, or Bluffing, and Maya, or Cheating. These two demons were taken by a demon named Nirriti, who had no children.</P>
<P>Maitreya told Vidura: O great soul, from Dambha and Maya were born Greed and Nikriti, or Cunning. From their combination came children named Krodha (Anger) and Himsa (Envy), and from their combination were born Kali and his sister Durukti (Harsh Speech).</P>
<P>O greatest of all good men, by the combination of Kali and Harsh Speech were born children named Mrityu (Death) and Bhiti (Fear). From the combination of Mrityu and Bhiti came children named Yatana (Excessive Pain) and Niraya (Hell).&quot; <EM>(SB 4.8.2-4)</EM></P></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>The <EM>Srimad Bhagavatam</EM> describes how the personified Kali rules over this age through four main sinful activities:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;Suta Gosvami said: Maharaja Pariksit, thus being petitioned by the personality of Kali, gave him permission to reside in places where gambling, drinking, prostitution and animal slaughter were performed.&quot; <EM>(SB 1.17.38)</EM></P>
<P>&quot;The personality of Kali asked for something more, and because of his begging, the King gave him permission to live where there is gold because wherever there is gold there is also falsity, intoxication, lust, envy and enmity.&quot; <EM>(SB 1.17.39)</EM></P></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>When Srila Prabhupada speaks about the Earth being over-run by a demoniac force, he is referring to a supernatural power that is influencing and controlling all aspects of political, economic, military, religious, social and cultural aspects of life in the modern world. What to speak of people who have no access to Srila Prabhupada's message, unfortunately many members of the International Society for Krishna Consciousness are not conscious of, or able to recognize that the world system they work within, (<EM>or for</EM>), is <EM>asuric</EM> in nature, and for the most part is governed by people who <EM>either consciously or unconsciously </EM>are administering policies on behalf of a supernatural evil force (the personified Kali-yuga).</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;People in general are not very advanced in knowledge by which to discriminate between religion and irreligion. The innocent, unenlightened citizen is like an ignorant animal sleeping in peace with its head on the lap of its master, faithfully believing in the master's protection.&quot; <EM>(SB 6.2.6)</EM></P></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>In the purport to the above verse Srila Prabhupada says: &quot;In this age, animals are kept nicely sheltered, completely confident that their masters will protect them, but unfortunately as soon as the animals are fat, they are immediately sent for slaughter.&quot; The comparison is to the innocent public who are fed and sheltered by the asuric government, but only to keep them alive for the purpose of exploitation, and to ultimately dispose of them when they become a burden or unnecessary.</P>
<P>In our own life-time we have lived under a regime which though pertaining to be made of individual and autonomous nation states, is actually a one world government that has stealthily introduced a poisonous atheistic ideology, an artificial monetary system that has caused economic enslavement to billions of people through-out the world, and a perpetual war machine which has caused death and injury to hundreds of millions of people through-out the world; it is a system which has introduced mass abortion, cow killing, illicit sex, gambling, and intoxication; it is a system that has introduced genetically modified foods, chemtrails, herbicides and pesticides, fluoridated water, toxic pharmaceuticals and vaccines, widespread ecological destruction, etc.; the list goes on and on. Though individual politicians have changed or died and been replaced by others, the same tamasic system of government has continued. Now in the midst of a 'COVID-19 pandemic', we are expected to believe that this one world government is suddenly concerned for the lives and health of people threatened by the COVID-19. Does a vulture wish the cow to be alive or dead? And does a vulture government wish for the physical, economic and spiritual health of its citizens?</P>

<P>&quot;Uncivilized rogues, vultures, <EM>rakshasas </EM>[demons]—and they're leaders&quot;. <EM>(Journey of Self-Discovery, JSD 6.5, Slaughterhouse Civilization)</EM></P></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>Unfortunately for purposes of name and fame, members of ISKCON are so busy arranging every possible photo opportunity to be seen shaking hands with the local politician or celebrity (and thus lending credibility to those who administer the satanic system), that it has become nearly impossible for most devotees to discern or detect the insidious and covert nature of satanic government. Though many politicians are themselves unwitting pawns of a larger supernatural force, we should nonetheless understand that at this present time, where-ever there is a sphere of power and influence over others, one will find that the satanic or demoniac presence is operating in the background. This obviously includes major institutions such as the worlds religions and governments, finance and banking, military, education, health, and of course the media who are currently employing nothing less than trauma based mind control to convince the world's population that they are all likely to die from COVID-19 unless they do exactly what the world government orders.</P>
<P>When Srila Prabhupada uses the word <EM>asura</EM> or demon or satanic, he is not simply speaking in a polemical, rhetorical, or analogical way. He does not use the word whimsically as a cheap sling or insult to another person or group as we may use the word in hostility towards someone we don't like. When Srila Prabhupada uses the word 'demon' or 'satanic' it is in a very scientific way, and refers to the particular mentality and practices of souls covered by the lower modes of material nature (see Krishna's explanation of the demoniac nature in chapter 16 of the <EM>Bhagavad-gita</EM>). One could be a demon and not even realize it, or one could be under the control of demoniac leadership and not even realize it. For our enlightenment, the characteristics of the <EM>asura</EM> nature are described in <EM>Bhagavad-gita</EM> and <EM>Srimad Bhagavatam</EM>. Srila Prabhupada refers to others as demons on the basis of a spiritual science, and never whimsically.</P>
<P><STRONG>WHO IS IN CONTROL?</STRONG></P>
<P>Just as the supernatural power of Krishna and the <EM>devas</EM> is real, so the supernatural power of the <EM>asuras</EM> is also real. One can't believe in one and not the other. Indeed the demons derive their own power from Krishna Himself. Sri Krishna was not taken by surprise or placed into anxiety when Hiranyakasipu took over the universe; indeed, it was only by Krishna's own empowerment that he was able to do so. In fear, Hiranyakasipu inquired of his son:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;My son Prahlada, you rascal, you know that when I am angry all the planets of the three worlds tremble, along with their chief rulers. By whose power has a rascal like you become so impudent that you appear fearless and overstep my power to rule you?</P>
<P>Prahlada Maharaja said: My dear King, the source of my strength, of which you are asking, is also the source of yours. Indeed, the original source of all kinds of strength is one. He is not only your strength or mine, but the only strength for everyone. Without Him, no one can get any strength. Whether moving or not moving, superior or inferior, everyone, including Lord Brahma, is controlled by the strength of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.&quot; <EM>(SB 7.8.6-7)</EM></P></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>The <EM>asuras</EM> are not independent controllers. In all circumstances they can only operate by a power that comes ultimately from Krishna. There are complex factors involving karma, desire, free will, etc., which explains why Sri Krishna empowers the <EM>asuras</EM> as well as the <EM>devas</EM>, but in all circumstances, Sri Krishna is the absolute controller:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Disciple: In the Judeo-Christian tradition, God is at war with Satan. In Vedic literatures, there are also wars between the demigods and the demons, as well as Krishna and the demons, but these wars do not seem to be taken as serious confrontations between God and His enemies. Isn't Krishna's mood always playful?</P>
<P>Srila Prabhupada: Since Krishna is all-powerful, when He is fighting with demons He is actually playing. This fighting does not affect His energy. It is like a father fighting with his small child. The father may seem to be fighting seriously, but he is only playing: one slap is sufficient to subdue the child. Similarly, Krishna sometimes plays by giving the demons a chance to fight Him, but one strong slap is sufficient. There is no question of fighting with God on an equal level. He is omnipotent. However, when a living entity is disobedient and harasses the devotees, God kills him. When Krishna descends on this earth, He chastises the demons and protects His devotees (<EM>paritranaya sadhunam vinasaya ca dushkritam</EM>). Whenever there is a fight between the demons and the demigods, God takes the side of the demigods.</P>
<P>Disciple: Mill saw it more like an actual struggle between God and Satan, or evil.</P>
<P>Srila Prabhupada: There is struggle because the demons are always transgressing God's rules. A demon is one who rejects God's rules, and a demigod is one who accepts them. That is the main difference, as stated in the sastras.</P>
<P>Disciple: But Mill pictures God Himself as struggling hard in the fight to conquer the demons.</P>
<P>Srila Prabhupada: God has no reason to struggle. According to the Vedas, He is so powerful that He has nothing to strive for (<EM>na tasya karyam karanam ca vidyate</EM>). Just as a king may have many servants, ministers, and soldiers to carry out his desires, Krishna has many energies that act according to His order. Krishna Himself has nothing to do but play on His flute and enjoy Himself. That is why the Vedas declare, <EM>ananda-mayo 'bhyasat</EM>: &quot;God is always blissful.&quot;</P>
<P>So, God has no reason to struggle for anything because nobody is equal to or greater than Him (<EM>na tat-samas cabhyadikas ca drisyate</EM>). But if God is not working hard, then how are things happening? <EM>Parasya saktir vividhaiva sruyate</EM>: Through the agency of God's multi-energies everything is going on systematically and naturally (<EM>svabhaviki jnana-bala-kriya ca</EM>). For example, by God's order the sun rises early in the morning, exactly on time. So although God is enjoying Himself, the universe is going on in accordance with His orders. There is no question of God struggling against evil. His various agents can kill all the evil elements in the world easily enough.</P>

<P>Prabhupada: That you also, you have to get. That's all right. He was once God, he was once rich. That's all right. But how he has become poor? He was at sometimes God, accepted. But how he has become dog instead of God? But God is susceptible to such falldown? Then what kind of God he is? If God is subjected sometimes to fall down, then he is not all-powerful. Then the cause which has made him fall down, that is powerful. Therefore he is not God. God is all-powerful. So why other power will make him to come down from the position of God? Then that power is powerful. But God is all-powerful; therefore he is not God. This is common reasoning. God cannot be subjected to any other external... Just like according to Biblical philosophy, &quot;God and Satan.&quot; God is never under the influence of Satan. Is there any statement in the Bible that &quot;God has become under the influence of Satan&quot;? Then Satan become great. God is not great. Similarly, if by some cause, by Satanic cause, one has fallen down from the position of God to the position of dog, then that Satan is greater than God. But God is great. Therefore he is not God. Gaursundara? How do you think this argument?</P>
<P>Gaursundara: Yes.</P>
<P>Prabhupada: Yes. God cannot be under the influence of anything so that He may fall down. That is not God, because God is all-powerful. Why He should be influenced by any other power? Then what kind of God? Then he is not God. Just try to understand how to argue.<BR><EM>(SB 7.9.8, Hawaii, March 21 1969)</EM></P></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>Armed with the knowledge that Sri Krishna remains the supreme controller in all circumstances, and that Sri Krishna acts for the ultimate good of beings (including those demons trapped in the lower modes of nature), the devotees of Sri Krishna should not be overwhelmed by fear in the face of the satanic system. Rather, like cowherd boys who accepted Sri Krishna as their only protector, the devotees should playfully and fearlessly go on with the chanting of the Holy Names of Sri Sri Radha-Krishna. The Puranas declare that Kali will have no jurisdiction over the devotees of Hari. However, lest an aspiring devotee of Sri Krishna fall victim to the seductive power of Kali or his servants, one should not be ignorant of the difference between a person in divine consciousness and one in demoniac consciousness, nor should one be naive to the hidden practices and actions of the <EM>asura</EM> tribe.</P>
<P><STRONG>SATANIC RITUAL AND HUMAN SACRIFICE</STRONG></P>
<P>Just as powerful messengers of Godhead like Srila Prabhupada can enter our reality in an apparent physical form whilst remaining transcendentally connected to the Supreme Personality of Godhead and executing his mission on the Earth, in the same way, powerful <EM>asuras</EM> can appear in a physical form whilst remaining connected to the mission of their higher demoniac powers and duly executing their mission on the Earth. Just as devotees get empowerment from Sri Krishna through the performance of sankirtan <EM>yajna </EM>(sacrifice), so the <EM>asuras</EM> and their agents get empowerment through satantic rituals and incantations in which children and others are ritualistically abused and sacrificed. Kali remains in the invisible realm, and works through his agents on the physical plane.</P>
<P>In Canto 12 of <EM>Srimad Bhagavatam</EM>, Sukadeva Gosvami explains the nature of demoniac leadership in the Kali-age when <EM>asuras</EM> in the disguise of worldly leaders will literally murder and devour their subjects, either openly in devastating wars or secretly in occult practices.</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;These barbarians in the guise of kings will devour the citizenry, <STRONG>murdering</STRONG> innocent women (<EM>stri)</EM>, children (<EM>bala</EM>), cows (<EM>go</EM>), and brahmanas (<EM>dvija</EM>)&quot; <EM>(SB 12.1.39-40)</EM></P></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P><EM><FONT face="verdana" size="2">Murder or killing (ghnah) is not a metaphore. Nor does Sukadeva Goswami use the word bhaksha (eating the citizens) simply in a metaphorical sense</EM> (<EM>prajah</EM>—the citizens; <EM>te</EM>—they; <EM>bhakshayishyanti</EM>—will virtually devour). In Kali-yuga, the asuric leaders literally eat the flesh and blood of their unfortunate victims. It may come as a surprise to hear that venerated public figures could possibly be involved in such practices, but that is why we have to see present events through the eyes of <EM>shastra</EM>. What is the cause of the great disturbances in the world at the present time? In <EM>Srimad Bhagavatam</EM> 3.13.3-15, it describes how natural calamities, spiritual and social breakdown, etc., are signs of the prevalence of <EM>asuras</EM> taking birth on the Earth.</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;When natural disturbances occur on a planet, one should understand that a demon must have taken birth there. In the present age the number of demoniac people is increasing; therefore natural disturbances are also increasing. <EM>There is no doubt about this, as we can understand from the statements of the Bhagavatam. </EM>&quot; <EM>(Purport SB 3.17.4)</EM></P>
<P>&quot;When there are natural disturbances like blowing cyclones, too much heat or snowfall, and uprooting of trees by hurricanes, it is to be understood that the demoniac population is increasing and so the natural disturbance is also taking place. There are many countries on the globe, even at the present moment, where all these disturbances are current. This is true all over the world. There is insufficient sunshine, and there are always clouds in the sky, snowfall, and severe cold. These assure that such places are inhabited by demoniac people who are accustomed to all kinds of forbidden, sinful activity.&quot; <EM>(Purport SB 3.17.5)</EM></P></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>In chapter 16 of the <EM>Bhagavad-gita</EM>, Lord Krishna explains the demoniac nature. In verse 16. Lord Krishna says:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;Taking shelter of insatiable lust and absorbed in the conceit of pride and false prestige, the demoniac, thus illusioned, are always sworn to unclean work (<EM>asuci-vrata</EM>), attracted by the impermanent. (Bg 16.8)</P></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>In his commentary to this verse the great Vaishnava <EM>acharya </EM>Sridhar Swami describes the various black magic or satanic sacrifices (<EM>asuci vrata</EM>) which includes human sacrifice:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;Continuing further Lord Krishna describes that the demoniac pursue desires impossible to accomplish. <STRONG>Possessed of hypocrisy and mendacity the demoniac resort to the worship of discarnate demons, ghastly ghosts, and satanic spirits in their attempts to increase their power and longevity. </STRONG>The demoniac by executing such depraved and degraded actions are completely ensnared by delusion and obstinately execute degenerative activities of diabolical dimensions with impure minds, <STRONG>in an impure state with <U>impure ingredients such as blood and fat from the killing of animals as well as humans</U> at inauspicious times such at midnight on inauspicious days and astrological alignments such as lunar eclipses and <EM>amavasya</EM> or new moon in their diabolical obsession and lust for power.&quot;</STRONG></P></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>In Sripad Ramanuja's commentary to this verse, he writes:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;Lord Krishna explains that the demoniac are propelled by lust and greed that is insatiable and constantly seeking to be fulfilled in the hope of being gratified. The demoniac endeavour to procure such fulfillment is <EM>mohad </EM>or deluded illusion and through gross improprieties they forcefully misappropriate and enjoy things which are not lawfully theirs. <STRONG>The compound word <EM>asuci-vratah </EM>means the demoniac fiendishly execute devilish rituals such as <U>blood sacrifices and the killing of animals and even humans</U> in following their diabolical rites. Specifically engaging in forbidden acts prohibited by the Vedic scriptures which oppose all sense of righteousness, morality and decency. <EM><U>By resorting to duplicity, hypocrisy, sorcery, evil magic, and surreptitious deception the demoniac nature is able to prevail and flourish. </U></EM>&quot;</STRONG></P></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>Again, Kesava Kasmiri Acharya writes of 'diabolical vows of deranged depravity':</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;Lord Krishna further clarifies that the demoniac harbouring insatiable lusts and desires invent false doctrines to corroborate their heinous activities <STRONG>fostered by vile and diabolical vows of deranged depravity. </STRONG>At inauspicious times such as midnight and during thunderstorms, on inauspicious days such as new moon and eclipses and at inauspicious places such as crematoriums and cemeteries; <EM>the demoniac exuding evil, and full of impurity, hypocrisy, deviousness, belligerence, arrogance and pretentiousness </EM><STRONG><U>offer blood of animals and even humans in their diabolical worship</U> of disincarnate ghosts, spirits, hobgoblins and demons.&quot;</STRONG></P></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P><EM><FONT face="verdana" size="2">Srimad Bhagavatam</EM> mentions a particular hell for people who engage in satanic practices involving torture and eating and drinking of human flesh and blood. The thing is mentioned because such dark practices actually go on:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;There are men and women in this world who sacrifice human beings to Bhairava or Bhadra Kali and then eat their victims' flesh. Those who perform such sacrifices are taken after death to the abode of Yamaräja, where their victims, having taken the form of Rakshasas, cut them to pieces with sharpened swords. Just as in this world the man-eaters drank their victims' blood, dancing and singing in jubilation, their victims now enjoy drinking the blood of the sacrificers and celebrating in the same way&quot;. <EM>(SB 5.26.31)</EM></P></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>Such practices always have been, and always will be the <EM>modus operandi </EM>of diabolical <EM>asuras</EM>; and it is always Krishna's mission to expose and destroy such evil practices. The following account from <EM>Mahabharata </EM>narrates Krishna's confrontation with the <EM>asura</EM> Jarasandha who had imprisoned 20,000 kings (see SB 10.70.24) with the intention of offering them as a human sacrifice to Maha-bhairava. The account is interesting because it describes how Jarasandha presented himself as a virtuous ruler, and protested that Krishna's opposition to him was unfounded. Krishna the Supersoul in everyone's heart, and seer of everything, was not to be fooled by such a cloak of piety:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;Jarasandha said, 'I do not recollect if I ever acted injuriously towards ye! Even upon a careful mental scrutiny I fail to see the injury I did unto ye. When I have never done ye an injury, why, ye Brahmanas do ye regard me, who am innocent, as your foe? O, answer me truly, for this, indeed, is the rule followed by the honest. The mind is pained at the injury to one's pleasure and morality. That Kshatriya who injures an innocent man's (sources of) pleasure and morality even if he be otherwise a great warrior and well-versed in all rules of morality, obtains, without any doubt the fate of sinners (hereafter) and falls off from prosperity. The practices of the Kshatriyas are the best of those that are honest in the three worlds Indeed, those that are acquainted with morality applaud the Kshatriya practices. <EM>Adhering to those practices of my order with steady soul, I never injure those that are under me. In bringing this charge, therefore, against me, it appears that ye speak erroneously!'</EM></P>
<P>Krishna said,--'O thou of mighty arms, there is a certain person of the head of a (royal) line who upholdeth the dignity of his race At his command have we come against thee. Thou hast brought, O king, many of the Kshatriyas of the world as captives (to thy city.) <STRONG>Having perpetrated that wicked wrong how dost thou regard thyself as innocent? O best of monarchs, how can a king act wrongfully towards other virtuous kings? But thou, O king, treating other kings with cruelty, seekest to offer them as sacrifice unto the god Rudra! O son of Vrihadratha, this sin committed by thee may touch even us, for as we are virtuous in our practices, we are capable of protecting virtue. The slaughter of human being as sacrifice unto the gods is never seen. Why dost thou, therefore, seek to perform a sacrifice unto god Sankara by slaughtering human beings? Thou art addressing persons belonging to thy own order as animals (fit for sacrifice)! </STRONG>Fool as thou art, who else, O Jarasandha, is capable of behaving in this way? One always obtaineth the fruits of whatever acts one performeth under whatever circumstances. Therefore, desirous as we are of helping all distressed people, we have, for the prosperity of our race, come hither to slay thee, the slaughterer of our relatives.&quot; <EM>(Mahabharata, Sabha Parva, Section XXII)</EM></P></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>Here Krishna exposes the nefarious hidden activities of Jarasandha and duly arranges for his death at the hands of Bhima. The present satanic leadership of the world will be similarly exposed and defeated by those empowered by Sri Krishna to do so. When the evidence of such diabolical practices are eventually released to the mainstream audience, it will create such a shock to the world that the present system will not be able to stand.</P>
<P>In <EM>Srimad Bhagavatam</EM> it describes how the <EM>asura</EM> Kamsa, in order to maintain his power, had personally slaughtered six children belonging to Devaki and Vasudeva; he also sent blood drinking demons to kill new-born children in the area of Vraja:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;O King of the Bhoja dynasty, beginning today we shall kill all the children born in all the villages, towns and pasturing grounds within the past ten days or slightly more.&quot; <EM>(SB 10.4.31)</EM></P>
<P>&quot;These demons, the followers of Kamsa, were expert at persecuting others, especially the Vaishnavas, and could assume any form they desired. After giving these demons permission to go everywhere and persecute the saintly persons, Kamsa entered his palace.&quot; <EM>(SB 10.4.44)</EM></P></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>It mentions here that the demons could change their form according to their desire (<EM>kama-rupa-dharan</EM>).</P>
<P>One such demon was Putana:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;While Nanda Maharaja was returning to Gokula, the same fierce Putana whom Kamsa had previously engaged to kill babies was wandering about in the towns, cities and villages, doing her nefarious duty.&quot; <EM>(SB 10.6.2)</EM></P>
<P>&quot;Putana Rakshasi, who could move according to her desire and was wandering in outer space, converted herself by mystic power into a very beautiful woman and thus entered Gokula, the abode of Nanda Maharaja.&quot; <EM>(SB 10.6.4)</EM></P></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>Putana's job description is &quot;Baby Killer&quot; (<EM>bala-grahah</EM>—the witch, whose business was to kill small babies). It also mentions her deceptive appearance:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;Putana Rakshasi's heart was fierce and cruel, but she looked like a very affectionate mother. Thus she resembled a sharp sword in a soft sheath.&quot; <EM>(SB 10.6.9)</EM></P></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>Her actual delight was to kill children and drink their blood:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;Putana was always hankering for the blood of human children (<EM>rudhira-ashana</EM>—hankering for blood), and with that desire she came to kill Krishna.&quot; <EM>(SB 10.6.35-36)</EM></P></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>Likewise, the demon Aghasura intended to kill Krishna and the other cowherd boys by 'swallowing' them (SB 10.12.16). The demon Dhenukasura was also an eater of human flesh (<EM>krta-nara-aharat</EM>) <EM>(SB 10.15.24) </EM>.</P>
<P>There are many such examples of black practices that were happening at the time of Krishna's appearance, and the same practices are rife today in the controlling powers of this world. Through control of the media, the <EM>asuras</EM> can pose as respected heads of government, venerated religious leaders, leaders of industry, banking and commerce, glamorous pop stars, movie idols, and celebrities, justices of law and order, police and army heads, etc., and the unsuspecting population have no idea of their real nature and practices involving human sacrifice, and ritualistic abuse and torture. Even followers of Srila Prabhupada may fail to take seriously or accept that such practices go on at the highest levels of society, and that they are directly connected to a supernatural realm:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>There are many real-life beautiful Putana's in high places sucking the blood of children in satanic sacrifices throughout the world <EM>right now</EM>. Though the physical body of an incarnate witch may appear human, the subtle body is actually that of a <EM>pishaci</EM>. Likewise, though the physical body of a blood-drinking <EM>rakshasa </EM>may appear like an ordinary human, the subtle body is actually that of a <EM>rakshasa</EM>. People with <EM>rakshasa</EM> consciousness may look human, but they do think or behave in a 'humane' manner. Since most people in the world have both a gross and a subtle body that is 'human', it is practically impossible to understand the diabolic activities of those who appear in a human form, but are actually 'non-human' in consciousness.</P>
<P>In the <EM>Srimad Bhagavatam</EM> it describes how witches and female demons become intoxicated from drinking blood (<EM>asrk-asavam</EM>—the blood, compared to an intoxicating beverage).</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;Leaping violently from the altar, she immediately decapitated all the rogues and thieves with the very sword with which they had intended to kill Jada Bharata. She then began to drink the hot blood that flowed from the necks of the beheaded rogues and thieves, as if this blood were liquor. Indeed, she drank this intoxicant with her associates, who were witches and female demons. Becoming intoxicated with this blood, they all began to sing very loudly and dance as though prepared to annihilate the entire universe. At the same time, they began to play with the heads of the rogues and thieves, tossing them about as if they were balls&quot;. <EM>(SB 5.9.18)</EM></P></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>Despite the superficial appearance of attraction and affection, Putana was a blood-sucking witch. One may be very surprised to learn that such witches pervade the glamorous world of entertainment, media, politics, etc. There is enough testimony from survivors of satanic ritual abuse to convince a person that high-level satanic ritual abuse and murder is not simply the stuff of movies, but is integral to the functioning of the present world system of politics, economics, media, religion, entertainment, etc. I leave it to the reader to make their own research into the particulars of the subject. If one wishes to 'calculate the dark side' as Srila Prabhupada recommended us to do, one will open an ugly can of worms that shows that demoniac culture and supernatural realm is not only real and present, but that the satanic force is <EM>in control of the governments of the world</EM> (albeit very insidiously).</P>

<P>Through seduction and various allurements people of uncontrolled senses are brought into the sphere of the <EM>asuras</EM>; and by various means involving blackmail, or further inducements, or rites of initiation, etc., such weak people gradually come completely under the control of the <EM>asuras</EM>. The satanic ritual not only creates a connection with the supernatural power, it allows those in the lower modes to fulfill their perverted desires of torturing and murdering human beings, and to further debase and dehumanize any newcomers so that all love and empathy towards other living beings is destroyed. Through various networks, such servants of the <EM>asuras</EM> are placed in positions of leadership, power, and influence, and then enact and encourage laws that allow illicit sex, intoxication, gambling and meat eating; by these four means the people become degraded, weak, easily controllable, and unable to perceive the nature of their material and spiritual captivity. This is a very unhappy and obviously destructive situation for all involved. It is the antithesis of love which is the natural and eternal disposition of every soul. It is the expressed desire of Sri Krishna Chaitanya Mahaprabhu to free everyone from this abominable condition.</P>
<P>The shocking exposure of the satanic practices among many of the world's ruling elite will be part of the gradual downfall of the present system.</P>
<P><STRONG>HE HAS COME ALREADY</STRONG></P>
<P>Since the satanic government controls all agencies of power and influence, from what quarter will a champion come?</P>

<P>When Kamsa was at the zenith of his power, who would have expected that the youthful Krishna would suddenly drag the untouchable King Kamsa from his throne, and literally punch him to death in full view of all.</P>

<P>Likewise now that the satanic government is at the zenith of its power, who expects to see its leaders similarly dragged down, and delivered justice in full view of all. Srila Prabhupada says:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;So this will give impetus to Krishna consciousness movement. <EM>Yada yada hi dharmasya glanir bhavati </EM>[Bg. 4.7]. Don't be disappointed. <STRONG>Krishna will act through His movement and kill them, these demons. How it will be done, that you cannot know now, but it will be done.&quot;</STRONG><BR><EM>(Evening Darshan, February 15, 1977, Mayapur)</EM></P>
<P>&quot;If we remain sincere, even we are feeble, new-born, nobody can kill us. That is a fact. <STRONG>Just like Krishna when He was three months old, attempt was made by Putana to kill Him, but the Putana was killed&quot;. </STRONG><EM>(Room Conversation, May 3 1976 Honolulu)</EM></P></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>Though Srila Prabhupada says that 'Krishna will act through His movement and kill these demons', he certainly does not advocate that the devotees of Sri Krishna should engage in a physical warfare with asuras. The destruction of the demoniac system is caused by the chanting of the Names of God, not by physical killing, as explained in the following lectures:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;Hare Krishna movement is also astra [weapon] of Krishna for killing the demons, but it is not like a... Like a sword, it is not active. But it is astra. <STRONG>It is killing the demons but in a different way. The demonic habits are being killed, demonic habits. Everyone, we can understand it, how our demonic activities are being killed by this Hare Krishna movement.</STRONG> This is astra. This is astra, but it is being used in a different way, because in this age they are so fallen. So... <EM>Manda manda-bhagya</EM>. This real astra weapon cannot be used upon them. It is already dead. So therefore another type of astra to awaken them to life, that is Hare Krishna, maha-mantra astra. Otherwise they are already dead. A dead horse... &quot;Beating the dead horse.&quot; A horse is dead; what you will get by beating with whips? It is already dead. So there are big, big demons. Hiranyakasipu, he was required to be killed by the nails of the Lord. He appeared as a ferocious lion. <STRONG>But here, the tiny demons, there is no need of nails or any sword. They are to be awakened simply by Krishna consciousness, chanting Hare Krishna.</STRONG><BR><EM>(Srimad Bhagavatm 7.9.47, April 2 1976 Vrindavana)</EM></P></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>Regarding the seemingly horrific demise of Kamsa, we should remember that Kamsa had personally slaughtered the six children of Devaki, and also sent evil demons such as Putana to capture and kill newborn children in the region of Mathura. Despite engaging in heinous activities, whenever demons such as Kamsa and Putana are killed by the personal touch of Sri Krishna, the contact with Krishna is so purifying that the soul of the demon does not go to hell, but is surprisingly granted freedom to go back to the kingdom of God. According to <EM>Bhagavad-gita</EM>, there is no such thing as an eternal demon. What we call a demon is originally a pure and good soul who due to misuse of freewill, becomes momentarily covered by the lower modes of nature, which causes them to act in a demoniac way. In the <EM>Srimad Bhagavatam </EM>it mentions the surprising destination of Kamsa, who due to fear had always thought of the Lord:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;Kamsa had always been disturbed by the thought that the Supreme Lord was to kill him. Therefore when drinking, eating, moving about, sleeping or simply breathing, the King had always seen the Lord before him with the disc weapon in His hand. Thus Kamsa achieved the rare boon of attaining a form like the Lord's. <EM>(SB 10.44.39)</EM></P>
<P>PURPORT<BR>Although born out of fear, Kamsa's constant meditation on the Supreme Lord eradicated all his offenses, and therefore the demon was liberated upon his death at the Lord's hands.&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>Likewise, upon her death at the hands of Sri Krishna, the soul of Putana was liberated and allowed to enter the kingdom of God. One may wonder how an evil demon can go to heaven rather than to hell, but as mentioned previously, every soul is originally and eternally a servant of Godhead, and our original nature is only temporarily covered by the lower modes of nature (like a cloud covering the sun-shine). When Sri Krishna incarnates in the world, He frees all the captive souls from these lower modes, and brings everyone back home. Thus the happy ever after ending to the beautiful story of Sri Krishna (<EM>Srimad Bhagavatam</EM>) is that all the demons killed by the Lord got released from their demoniac mind-set, and went back to home, back to Godhead. The Supreme Personality of Godhead has presently appeared in the form of transcendental sound (Hare Krishna Maha-mantra) and will likewise deliver all souls from their satanic or demoniac covering.</P>
