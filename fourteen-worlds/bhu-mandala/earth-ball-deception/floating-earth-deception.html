<p align="center"><a href="http://www.iskcon-truth.com/bhu-mandala/floating-earth.html" target="_blank">Does the Earth Float in Space</a>? </p>
<p>The most  universally accepted scientific belief today is that the earth is a globe,  spinning on its axis at a speed of approximately 1,000 miles per hour at the  equator, while at the same time it is orbiting the sun at approximately 66,600  miles per hour. All of this is happening as the sun, in turn, is supposed to be  hurtling through the Milky Way galaxy at approximately 500,000 miles per hour. The  Milky Way galaxy, itself, is alleged to be racing through space at a speed  ranging from 300,000 to 1,340,000 miles per hour. What most people are not told  is that the purported spinning, orbiting, and speeding through space <strong>have never been proven</strong>. Astronomers and scientists have not proved that the  Earth is moving. In fact, every scientific experiment that has ever been  performed to determine the motion of the earth <strong>has proven that the earth is stationary</strong>. Yet, modern textbooks  ignore the scientific proof that contradicts the myth of a spinning and  orbiting globe, which is just a theory and concoction. <br>
  Religious  schools have been hoodwinked into teaching heliocentrism, despite the clear  teaching in the Holy Scriptures that the earth is not a sphere and does not  move. And from our Earthly perspective, the planets and stars appear the same  regardless of whether it’s the Copernican heliocentric view or the Tychonic  geocentric view. For millions of years the same stars moving aroud the pole-star which is stationary and not moving. The deception is that the satanic elite have caused people to  promote the heliocentric view based on the materialistic concept, to not  involve a Creator in the explanation of the intelligent design of the universe. </p>

<h2>The Fake  Earth - <br>
  the Greatest  Deception of Mankind </h2>
<p>Devotee  (3): Prabhupāda, when they said 
they  went to the moon and they showed films 
of them  landing and walking on the moon, 
was this  all a bluff?<br>
Prabhupāda:  Yes, here they... 
All  laboratory work, that's all.<br>
Devotee  (3): They all made it up?<br>
Prabhupāda:  Yes.<br>
Prabhupāda: &quot;Just like twenty years ago I said,  &quot;This is all nonsense,&nbsp;moon-going.&quot; 
  And now they are coming: &quot;Oh, it is hoax.&quot; <br>
  So that is the difference. Twenty years before 
and &quot;This is all childish waste of money.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Why the Great  Deception</h2>
<p><strong>DIRECT ANSWER</strong>: it is the age old battle of the demoniac against the divine; of the materialists against the spiritualists; of the atheists against the religious.</p>
<p><strong>Srila Prabhupada</strong>: The demoniac conclude that the world is phantasmagoria. <u>There is no cause, no effect, no controller, no purpose</u>: everything is unreal. They say that this cosmic manifestation arises due to chance material actions and reactions. <u>They do not think that the world was created by God for a certain purpose</u>. They have their own theory: that the world has come about in its own way and that there is <u>no reason to believe that there is a God behind it</u>. For them there is no difference between spirit and matter, and <u>they do not accept the Supreme Spirit</u>. Everything is matter only, and the whole cosmos is supposed to be a mass of ignorance. (BG 16.8 purport)</p>
<p><strong>Srila Prabhupada</strong>: <u>The demoniac are engaged in activities that will lead the world to destruction</u>. The Lord states here that they are less intelligent. The materialists, who have no concept of God, think that they are advancing. But, according to Bhagavad-gita, they are unintelligent and devoid of all sense. They try to enjoy this material world to the utmost limit and therefore always engage in inventing something for sense gratification. Such materialistic inventions are considered to be advancement of human civilization, but the result is that people grow more and more violent and more and more cruel, cruel to animals and cruel to other human beings. They have no idea how to behave toward one another. Animal killing is very prominent amongst demoniac people. Such people are considered the enemies of the world because ultimately they will invent or create something which will bring destruction to all. Indirectly, this verse anticipates the invention of nuclear weapons, of which the whole world is today very proud. At any moment war may take place, and these atomic weapons may create havoc. Such things are created solely for the destruction of the world, and this is indicated here. Due to godlessness, such weapons are invented in human society; they are not meant for the peace and prosperity of the world. (BG 16.9 purport)</p>
<p><strong>The Bhagavat-Gita (chapter 16),  reveals the truth about the grand-deception</strong>:</p>
<p>"Those who are demoniac do not know what is to be done and what is not to be done. Neither cleanliness nor proper behavior nor truth is found in them. They say that this world is unreal, that there is no foundation and that there is no God in control. It is produced of sex desire, and has no cause other than lust. Following such conclusions, the demoniac, who are lost to themselves and who have no intelligence, engage in unbeneficial, horrible works meant to destroy the world. The demoniac, taking shelter of insatiable lust, pride and false prestige, and being thus illusioned, are always sworn to unclean work, attracted by the impermanent. They believe that to gratify the senses unto the end of life is the prime necessity of human civilization. Thus there is no end to their anxiety. Being bound by hundreds and thousands of desires, by lust and anger, they secure money by illegal means for sense gratification. </p>
<p>The demoniac person thinks: 'So much wealth do I have today, and I will gain more according to my schemes. So much is mine now and it will increase in the future, more and more. He is my enemy, and I have killed him; and my other enemy will also be killed. I am the lord of everything, I am the enjoyer, I am perfect, powerful and happy. I am the richest man, surrounded by aristocratic relatives. There is none so powerful and happy as I am. I shall perform sacrifices, I shall give some charity, and thus I shall rejoice.' In this way, such persons are deluded by ignorance. Thus perplexed by various anxieties and bound by a network of illusions, one becomes too strongly attached to sense enjoyment and falls down into hell. Self-complacent and always impudent, deluded by wealth and false prestige, they sometimes perform sacrifices in name only without following any rules or regulations. Bewildered by false ego, strength, pride, lust and anger, the demon becomes envious of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is situated in his own body and in the bodies of others and blasphemes against the real religion. Those who are envious and mischievous, who are the lowest among men, are cast by Me into the ocean of material existence, into various demoniac species of life. Attaining repeated birth amongst the species of demoniac life, such persons can never approach Me. Gradually they sink down to the most abominable type of existence."  (<em>Bhagavad-Gita, verses 16.7-23</em>)</p>

<h2>Why Faking the Earth?</h2>
<p><strong>Prabhupāda</strong>: &quot;Without bluffing, how he can take money? Then they will  present themselves: &quot;I am great scientist, so give me money, millions of  dollars. I'll go to the moon planet, I'll go to the Mars,&quot; and taking  money and wasting. 
  That is their business. Miscreants. Actually, they want  money, but to take the money he has to bluff.&quot;&nbsp;</p>
<p>One of the biggest and most obvious reasons for such a massive lie is for money and world control. NASA makes billions a year off taxpayer dollars for one, and what is all that money going towards if it’s all fake? It takes money to fake a space station in a giant swimming pool and pay a bunch of computer geeks to create CGI’s (Computer Generated Images) of earth, but somebody’s pockets are getting full for sure.</p>
<p>NASA was started by men in the occult. All top level astroNOTS are Freemasons and the Satanic Kabballah is taught at NASA while the name “GOD” has been banned. You can research this yourself. Clearly these men are not promoting science but a pagan religion and a sinister agenda. (<a href="http://www.thelibertybeacon.com/the-occult-roots-of-nasa-and-the-ongoing-fraud/" target="_blank">The Occult Roots of NASA and the Ongoing Fraud</a>) </p>
<p>The Satanic elite have a Plan to create a one world government, or the New World Order, and to completely destroy religion and the belive in God.<br>
Kali has been working for the last 5,000 years to deceive humanity and the atheists work hard to remove God from this earth. Their ultimate goal is to get the whole world to reject the God of creation and to worship Satan and his image (see Rev. 13-14)</p>
<p>Some of Satan’s greatest deceptions and accomplishments have been to overtake the scientific world and convince the general population that <a href="http://www.prabhupadanugas.eu/news/?p=9756" target="_blank">we evolved from monkeys</a> and primordial soup (<a href="http://www.prabhupadanugas.eu/news/?p=9751" target="_blank">the Evolution Lie</a>) and that everything comes from a Big Bang (<a href="http://www.prabhupadanugas.eu/news/?p=8357" target="_blank">the  Big Bang Concoction</a>). These are Satanic lies of atheists.  These lies remove God from the universe and destroy the belief in the Lord's creation. They also destroy the validity of the Bible and other holy scriptures, such as the vedas. Many people have become atheists and God haters because of these pagan Satanic theories, <a href="https://flatearthscienceandbible.com/category/globe-deception/" target="_blank">propagated by atheists and materialist</a> whose only goal is to exploit the earth and its resources.</p>
<p>The theories of evolution, the Big Bang Theory, Atheism, the New Age movement, the New World Order, and the occult are all based on the ball earth theory. The spinning ball earth hurtling around a giant sun (Pagan Worship) is the foundation for all these Satanic beliefs. Without the ball earth all of these lies fall apart and have no foundation. <a href="http://www.iskcon-truth.com/bhu-mandala/earth-is-not-a-globe1.html" target="_blank">THE EARTH IST NOT A SPINNING BALL</a>. </p>
<p><strong>On the flat earth model evolution and the Big Bang don’t work</strong>. A flat stationary earth inside a glass dome with a close fixed “universe” of stars and wandering stars (planets) rotating around the dome points to a Designer! The flat earth points to God alone as our creator! It blows all of Satan’s deceptions out of the water. <u>It reveals God as the true creator</u> and points all creation to religious scriptures as the source of all truth, even science.</p>

<p>NASA is the biggest black budget hole in existence  sucking in over 30 billion dollars taxpayer money for the fake moon landings  alone, but it is about much more than just money.</p>
<p>The modern atheistic big bang heliocentric globe-ball-earth  chance evolution paradigm controls humanity by removing God or any sort of “intelligent  design”, and replacing purposeful divine creation with haphazard random cosmic  coincidence.</p>
<p>If the earth is the centre of the universe, then the  idea of God, creation, and a purpose for human existence are resplendent but if  the earth is just one of billion of planets revolving around billions of stars  in billions of galaxies, than the ideas of God, divine creation, and a specific  purpose for earth and human existence become highly implausible.</p>
<p>By surreptitiously indoctrinating people into so-called  scientific materialism not only do we loose faith in anything beyond the material,  but we gain absolute faith in atheism, selfishness, hedonism and consumerism. If  there is no God and everyone is just accident, than what reality matters is  “my, me, mine”.</p>
<p>The rich, powerful corporations, with slick mason cult  logos, sell us idols to worship, slowly taking over the world while we tacitly  believe their atheistic pseudo science. Vote for their politicians, buy their  products, listen to their music, and watch their movies, sacrificing our souls  at the altar of materialism and atheism. </p>
<p>Currently humanity is stuck in a very materialistic civilization   which is completely degrading and not at all conducive for the spiritual   evolution of the general public. One of the fundamental causes of this   materialistic society is the widespread belief in the completely false   theory that life comes from matter. If the people can believe life comes   from matter simply by random chance then they can avoid all spiritual   considerations completely.</p>
<p>In the <a href="http://prabhupadabooks.com/bg" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bhagavad Gita</a> Krishna completely smashes this idea by asserting that He is the source of everything and that everything emanates from Him. <a href="http://prabhupadabooks.com/bg" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bhagavad Gita</a> is so clear but because of the tendency of people to be envious,   because they do not want to accept anyone is greater them themselves,   they reject these very clear statements of Krishna and try and explain   them in some other way. This is very dishonest but that is what   practically every commentator on the Bhagavada Gita does, except of   course for His Divine Grace A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada. Srila   Prabhupada simply explains Bhagavad Gita “As It Is”, he simply presents   what Krishna actually says.</p>
<p><strong>Of all that is material and all that is spiritual in this world, know for certain that I am both its origin and dissolution.</strong>  (<a href="http://prabhupadabooks.com/bg/7/6" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Bhagavad-gita</em> 7.6</a>)</p>
<p>Everything that exists is a product of matter and spirit. Spirit is   the basic field of creation, and matter is created by spirit. Spirit is   not created at a certain stage of material development. Rather, this   material world is manifested only on the basis of spiritual energy. This   material body is developed because spirit is present within matter; a   child grows gradually to boyhood and then to manhood because of that   superior energy, spirit soul, being present. Similarly, the entire   cosmic manifestation of the gigantic universe is developed because of   the presence of the Supersoul, Visnu. Therefore spirit and matter, which   combine together to manifest this gigantic universal form, are   originally two energies of the Lord, and consequently the Lord is the   original cause of everything. <span id="more-47122"> </span></p>
<p>A fragmental part and parcel of the Lord, namely, the living entity,   may by manipulation of material energy construct a skyscraper, factory   or city, but he cannot create matter out of nothing, and he certainly   cannot construct a planet or a universe. The cause of the universe is   the Supersoul, Krsna, the supreme creator of all individual souls and   the original cause of all causes.</p>
