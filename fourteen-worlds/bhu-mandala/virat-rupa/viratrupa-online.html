<p align="center"><strong><span class="Stil1">In the material world the Lord is designated as virāṭ, hiraṇyagarbha and kāraṇa. <br>
  But beyond these three designations, the Lord is ultimately in the fourth dimension</span>.</strong></p>
<h3>Virāṭ-rūpa or Viśva-rūpa - the Lords Cosmic Form</h3>
<p>The description  of the Virāṭ-rūpa (virāṭ-puruṣa), the cosmic form of the Lord, is given in the <em>Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam</em>,  Canto 2, Chapter 1, <a href="https://prabhupadabooks.com/sb/2/1?d=1" target="_blank">Text 34-39</a>. </p>
<p>The description of the  gigantic form of the Personality of Godhead made in the Eleventh Chapter of  the&nbsp;<em>Bhagavad-gītā</em>&nbsp;is further explained here in  the&nbsp;<em>Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam.</em>&nbsp;The description in  the&nbsp;<em>Bhagavad-gītā</em>&nbsp;(<a href="https://prabhupadabooks.com/bg/11/30?d=1" target="_blank">11.30</a>) runs as follows:  &quot;O&nbsp;Viṣṇu, I see You devouring  all people in Your blazing mouths and covering all the universe by Your  immeasurable rays. Scorching the worlds, You are manifest.&quot; In that  way,&nbsp;<em>Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam</em>&nbsp;is the postgraduate study for  the student of the&nbsp;<em>Bhagavad-gītā.</em>&nbsp;Both of them are  the science of&nbsp;Kṛṣṇa, the Absolute Truth,  and so they are interdependent.</p>
<p>Persons who  are unable to pin their faith on the personal feature of the Absolute are given  a chance to associate with His virāṭ-rūpa, or the cosmic impersonal feature of  the Lord. <strong>Those who  want to see the Lord with their present material eyes or with the material  senses are advised to meditate on the gigantic external feature called the  virāṭ-rūpa</strong>. One should hear of the universal position of the virāṭ form of the  Lord as described in Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam. <u>That will help one save himself from  material conditional life and gradually elevate him to the path of liberation  so that he can go back home, back to Godhead</u>.</p>
<p>One is advised herewith to meditate upon the&nbsp;<em>virāṭ-rūpa</em>&nbsp;specified in the previous  chapters in order to understand how the different planets, seas, mountains,  rivers, birds, beasts, human beings, demigods and all that we can conceive are  but different parts and limbs of the Lord's&nbsp;<em>virāṭ</em>&nbsp;form. This sort of thinking  is also a type of meditation on the Absolute Truth, and as soon as such  meditation begins, one develops one's godly qualities, and the whole world  appears to be a happy and peaceful residence for all the people of the world.  Without such meditation on God, either personal or impersonal, all good  qualities of the human being become covered with misconceptions regarding his  constitutional position, and without such advanced knowledge, the whole world  becomes a hell for the human being.</p>
<p>The conception of  the&nbsp;<em>virāṭ-puruṣa,</em>&nbsp;or the gigantic  form of the Supreme Lord, is said to include all the dominating demigods as  well as the dominated living beings. Even the minutest part of a living being  is controlled by the empowered agency of the Lord. Since the demigods are  included in the gigantic form of the Lord, worship of the Lord, whether in His  gigantic material conception or in His eternal transcendental form as Lord  Śrī&nbsp;Kṛṣṇa, also appeases the  demigods and all the other parts and parcels, as much as watering the root of a  tree distributes energy to all of the tree's other parts. Consequently, for a  materialist also, worship of the universal gigantic form of the Lord leads one  to the right path. One need not risk being misled by approaching many demigods  for fulfillment of different desires. The real entity is the Lord Himself, and  all others are imaginary, for everything is included in Him only.</p>
<p>The  process of meditation recommended in the&nbsp;<em>Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam</em>&nbsp;is  not to fix one's attention on something impersonal or void. The meditation  should concentrate on the person of the Supreme Godhead, either in His&nbsp;<em>virāṭ-rūpa,</em>&nbsp;the gigantic universal form, or in  His&nbsp;<em>sac-cid-ānanda-vigraha</em><em>&nbsp;</em>[Bs.  5.1]<em>,</em>&nbsp;as described in the scriptures.  There are authorized descriptions of&nbsp;Viṣṇu&nbsp;forms, and  there are authorized representations of Deities in the temples. Thus one can  practice meditating upon the Deity, concentrating his mind on the lotus feet of  the Lord and gradually rising higher and higher, up to His smiling face. The  more one concentrates on the transcendental form of the Lord, either on the  lotus feet, the calves, the thighs or the chest, the more one becomes purified.</p>
<p>In  the <em>Bhagavad-gītā</em>&nbsp;<a href="https://prabhupadabooks.com/bg/11/19" target="_blank">11.19</a> Arjuna has seen the  Visva-rupa or cosmic form of the Lord and confirms that the sun and moon are  His eyes. Lord Krsna Himself states: “Of the Ādityas I am&nbsp;Viṣṇu, of lights I am the radiant sun, I  am&nbsp;Marīci&nbsp;of the Maruts, and among the stars I am the moon.” (<a href="https://prabhupadabooks.com/bg/10/22" target="_blank">BG  10.22</a>)</p>
<p>Arjuna&nbsp;saw  in that universal form unlimited mouths and unlimited eyes. It was all  wondrous. The form was decorated with divine, dazzling ornaments and arrayed in  many garbs. He was garlanded gloriously, and there were many scents smeared  over His body. All was magnificent, all-expanding, unlimited. This was seen  by&nbsp;Arjuna.</p>

  <p class="Stil1"><em>Jain Mandala painting with depiction of the universe as  double cosmic diagram and in the shape of a person. Each diagram centered by  Mount Meru surrounded by the concentric circles of the continents and the Sea  of salt filled with sea animals and lotus flowers. The edges embellished with  symbols of the worldly spheres like temples, figures, elephants, birds and  trees, at the outer rim a blue border with a frieze of goats. The cosmological  Jain Mandala shows Adhaidvipa, known as the two and a half continents where  mortals dwell. In the Jain cosmography the universe is divided into three  kingdoms: The upper with the celestials, the center with the mortals and the  lower with the damned. The continents are arranged concentrically and separated  by two annular oceans. The  central continent is called Jambudvipa, the internal ocean is known as  Lavaṇa-samudra (ocean of salt) and in the center there is Mount Meru.  In each of the four outer corners a Jina or Tirthankara, one of the 24  Jain saviours, is seated in meditating position.&nbsp;</em></p>

<p><strong>This gigantic  manifestation of the phenomenal material world as a whole is the personal body  of the Absolute Truth, wherein the universal resultant past, present and future  of material time is experienced</strong>. (<a href="https://prabhupadabooks.com/sb/2/1/24" target="_blank">SB 2.1.24</a>)</p>
<p><strong>The gigantic universal form of the Personality  of Godhead, within the body of the universal shell, which is covered by  sevenfold material elements, is the subject for the&nbsp;virāṭ&nbsp;conception</strong>. (<a href="https://prabhupadabooks.com/sb/2/1/25" target="_blank">SB 2.1.25</a>)</p>
<p><strong>Persons who have realized it have studied that  the planets known as&nbsp;Pātālaconstitute the bottoms of the feet of the  universal Lord, and the heels and the toes are the&nbsp;Rasātala&nbsp;planets.  The ankles are the Mahātala planets, and His shanks constitute the Talātala  planets</strong>. (<a href="https://prabhupadabooks.com/sb/2/1/26" target="_blank">SB  2.1.26</a>)</p>
<p>The  universe is divided into fourteen planetary systems. Seven planetary systems,  called Bhūr, Bhuvar, Svar, Mahar, Janas,&nbsp;Tapas&nbsp;and&nbsp;Satya, are  upward planetary systems, one above the other. There are also seven planetary  systems downward, known as Atala, Vitala,&nbsp;Sutala, Talātala,  Mahātala,&nbsp;Rasātala&nbsp;and&nbsp;Pātāla, gradually, one below the other.  In this verse, the description begins from the bottom because it is in the line  of devotion that the Lord's bodily description should begin from His feet.  Śukadeva Gosvāmī is a recognized devotee of the Lord, and he is exactly correct  in the description.</p>
<p><strong>The knees of the universal form are the  planetary system of the name&nbsp;Sutala, and the two thighs are the Vitala and  Atala planetary systems. The hips are Mahītala, and outer space is the  depression of His navel</strong>. (<a href="https://prabhupadabooks.com/sb/2/1/27" target="_blank">SB 2.1.27</a>)</p>
<p><strong>The chest of the Original Personality of the  gigantic form is the luminary planetary system, His neck is the Mahar planets,  His mouth is the Janas planets, and His forehead is  the&nbsp;Tapas&nbsp;planetary system. The topmost planetary system, known as  Satyaloka, is the head of He who has one thousand heads</strong>. (<a href="https://prabhupadabooks.com/sb/2/1/28" target="_blank">SB 2.1.28</a>)</p>
<p>The  effulgent luminary planets like the sun and the moon are situated almost in the  midplace of the universe, and as such they are to be known as the chest of the  original gigantic form of the Lord. And above the luminary planets, called also  the heavenly places of the universal directorate demigods, are the Mahar, Janas  and&nbsp;Tapas&nbsp;planetary systems, and, above all, the Satyaloka  planetary system, where the chief directors of the modes of material nature  reside, namely&nbsp;Viṣṇu,&nbsp;Brahmā&nbsp;and Śiva. This&nbsp;Viṣṇu&nbsp;is known as the Kṣīrodakaśāyī&nbsp;Viṣṇu, and He acts as the Supersoul in every living being. There  are innumerable universes floating on the Causal  Ocean, and in each of them the  representation of the&nbsp;<em>virāṭ</em>&nbsp;form of  the Lord is there along with innumerable suns, moons, heavenly demigods,  Brahmās, Viṣṇus and Śivas,  all of them situated in one part of the inconceivable potency of Lord&nbsp;Kṛṣṇa, as stated in the&nbsp;<em>Bhagavad-gītā</em>&nbsp;(<a href="https://prabhupadabooks.com/bg/10/42?d=1" target="_blank">10.42</a>).</p>

<p align="left"><strong>His arms are the demigods headed by&nbsp;Indra,  the ten directional sides are His ears, and physical sound is His sense of  hearing.

(<a href="https://prabhupadabooks.com/sb/2/1/29" target="_blank">SB 2.1.29</a>)</p>
<p><strong>The sphere of outer  space constitutes His eyepits, and the eyeball is the sun as the power of  seeing. His eyelids are both the day and night, and in  the movements of His eyebrows, the&nbsp;Brahmā&nbsp;and similar supreme  personalities reside. His palate is the director of water,&nbsp;Varuṇa, and the  juice or essence of everything is His tongue</strong>. (<a href="https://prabhupadabooks.com/sb/2/1/30" target="_blank">SB 2.1.30</a>)</p>
<p><strong>They say that the Vedic hymns are the cerebral  passage of the Lord, and His jaws of teeth are&nbsp;Yama, god of death, who  punishes the sinners. The art of affection is His set of teeth, and the  most alluring illusory material energy is His smile. This great ocean of  material creation is but the casting of His glance over us</strong>. (<a href="https://prabhupadabooks.com/sb/2/1/31" target="_blank">SB 2.1.31</a>)</p>
<p><strong>Modesty is the upper  portion of His lips, hankering is His chin, religion is the breast of the Lord,  and irreligion is His back. Brahmājī, who generates all living  beings in the material world, is His genitals, and the&nbsp;Mitrā-varuṇas are  His two testicles. The ocean is His waist, and the hills and mountains are the  stacks of His bones</strong>.  (<a href="https://prabhupadabooks.com/sb/2/1/32" target="_blank">SB 2.1.32</a>)</p>
<p><strong>O King, the rivers  are the veins of the gigantic body, the trees are the hairs of His body, and the  omnipotent air is His breath.

<p><strong>O best amongst the  Kurus, the clouds which carry water are the hairs on His head, the terminations  of days or nights are His dress, and the supreme cause of material creation is  His intelligence. His mind is the moon, the reservoir of all  changes</strong>. (<a href="https://prabhupadabooks.com/sb/2/1/34" target="_blank">SB  2.1.34</a>)</p>
<p><strong>The principle of  matter [mahat-tattva] is the consciousness of the omnipresent Lord, as asserted  by the experts, and Rudradeva is His ego. The horse,&nbsp;mule,  camel and elephant are His nails, and wild animals and all quadrupeds are  situated in the belt zone of the Lord</strong>. (<a href="https://prabhupadabooks.com/sb/2/1/35" target="_blank">SB 2.1.35</a>)</p>
<p><strong>Varieties of birds  are indications of His masterful artistic sense.&nbsp;Manu, the father of  mankind, is the emblem of His standard intelligence, and humanity is His  residence.

(<a href="https://prabhupadabooks.com/sb/2/1/36" target="_blank">SB 2.1.36</a>)</p>
<p><strong>The&nbsp;virāṭ-puruṣa's  face is the brāhmaṇas, His arms are the kṣatriyas, His thighs are the vaiśyas,  and the śūdras are under the protection of His feet. All the worshipable  demigods are also overtaken by Him, and it is the duty of everyone to perform  sacrifices with feasible goods to appease the Lord</strong>. (<a href="https://prabhupadabooks.com/sb/2/1/37" target="_blank">SB 2.1.37</a>)</p>
<p><strong>I have thus explained  to you the gross material gigantic conception of the Personality of Godhead.

(<a href="https://prabhupadabooks.com/sb/2/1/38" target="_blank">SB 2.1.38</a>)</p>
<p><strong>One should  concentrate his mind upon the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who alone  distributes Himself in so many manifestations just as ordinary persons create  thousands of manifestations in dreams. One must concentrate the mind on Him,  the only all-blissful Absolute Truth. Otherwise one will be misled and  will cause his own degradation</strong>.
