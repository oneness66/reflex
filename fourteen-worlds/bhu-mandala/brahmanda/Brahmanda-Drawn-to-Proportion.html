<p><strong>Brahmanda Drawn to Proportion</strong><br>
For  your reference I have properly drafted a view of Bhu-mandala to scale, shown  above. Following is a detail 'bird's eye view' of Brahmanda:</p>

<p>Also provided here is a Family Tree of the Srimad Bhagavatam (in two parts, below). This Bhagavatam Family Tree is typeset at 11 point font and at 100% size measures 16' wide x 6' High. It contains approximately 3,000 names from approx 563 slokas -- all from A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami's Bhagavatam. Each name is paired-up to its sloka number.</p>
<p>Each part of the Family Tree is a one-page document, done on a single MS Excel spreadsheet, including over a hundred color pictures of the very same personalities discussed in the Puranas. A multi-tiered timeline is displayed, including the brahma-madhva-gaudiya-sampradaya which is shown.</p>
<p>The images of the two Family Tree documents immediately below, are for quick reference only. <u>To properly view the Family Tree documents, you must view the PDF versions linked at bottom</u>. <strong>These will expand to very large format, clearly readable PDF documents</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>Technical Notes:</strong></p>
<p>I started the layout of these documents in approx 1998. It took me 8 total revisions to arrive at the format as seen now, left to right.</p>
<p>Each revision found me cutting and pasting branches of names by hand and scotch tape. Even the 90 degree set wordage was a struggle to accept as the defacto layout.</p>
<p>Each revision was proof read for accuracy and inclusion of the correct Chap/Verse sloka #.</p>
<p>I also did a post final alteration on the time line so as to show that Ramacandra lived in the 24 Munu's epoch.</p>
<p>Finally, the chart as you have it is the First Galley edition, with a final proof/edit still to be done.</p>
<p>I am happy to give these documents away to public domain for the interest of devotees and scholars. I do consider the chart to be esoteric and best seen by those who already familiar with contents.</p>
